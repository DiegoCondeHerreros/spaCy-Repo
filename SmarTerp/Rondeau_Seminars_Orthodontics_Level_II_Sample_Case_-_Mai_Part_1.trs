<Sync time="11.790"/>
 my next patient is Mai
<Sync time="15.478"/>
 and she is a female about 14 years old
<Sync time="17.959"/>
 and she's got a very (constricted arch) and a (tooth size discrepancy) 
<Sync time="22.745"/>
 we're talking at this time in this session about the (Bolton analysis) I'm gonna cover that in this presentation
<Sync time="29.732"/>
 but right now we're gonna talk about this 14 year-old girl now remember most girls will grow to 14 or 15 
<Sync time="35.490"/>
 so she still could have some (growth potential) left
<Sync time="38.323"/>
 but you can see with her smile is very narrow here 
<Sync time="41.595"/>
 got a very narrow (constricted arch) very narrow smile and we wanna fix that 
<Sync time="47.010"/>
 she's also got two (lingually displaced) (lateral incisors)
<Sync time="54.046"/>
 and she's got two (deciduous) lateral incisors in position but the (permanent) lateral incisors are lingually displaced 
<Sync time="60.808"/>
 and we've talked about this many times but the reason that the lateral incisors come in lingually displaced is 'cause you've got a narrow constricted (upper arch)
<Sync time="68.988"/>
 so that all could have been avoided if she'd had a an an (expansion appliance) when she was 6 7 8 9 10 11 whenever
<Sync time="77.85"/>
 or she wore it actually earlier before the laterals (erupted) so so the earlier the better probably the expansion appliance should have come in at 6 or 7 
<Sync time="86.040"/>
 and then they would have been room for the (lateral incisors) and then hopefully they wouldn't have erupted in the lingual
<Sync time="91.517"/>
 so again that's why the the treatment of children at an early age diagnosis and treatment is so important 
<Sync time="98.460"/>
 her profile looks very straight 
<Sync time="101.550"/>
 in fact it looks almost (prognathic) it looks like she could be a slight (class 3) she's either a class 3 or a (class 1) and again I don't have the (ceph) in the presentation 
<Sync time="112.725"/>
 but I have the ceph and all the (records) for all the cases but I just haven't shown you all the cephs and all the records for all the cases but for sure she looks like she could be a slight class 3 or or a class 1
<Sync time="123.274"/>
 let's look at the at the (occlusion) 
<Sync time="125.940"/>
 well if you look carefully you can see she's almost (end-to-end)
<Sync time="131.675"/>
 and over in this photo on the left it looks like the (lower incisors) are (lingually torqued) 
<Sync time="136.740"/>
 so when you see the lower incisor lingually torqued you've got to be suspicious of a (class 3)
<Sync time="142.071"/>
 plus the (cuspid) is slightly class 3 plus the (molar) is definitely class 3 
<Sync time="146.600"/>
 so you've got a class 3 molar class 3 cuspid lower incisors (lingually inclined) that's a class 3
<Sync time="152.147"/>
 and you hope now that she's all through growing 
<Sync time="155.205"/>
 but remember she's 14 she could grow to 15 and sometimes class 3 s even grow longer
<Sync time="162.231"/>
 so we have to be aware of that we have to worry that that the (mandible) might come forward on us and then that's definitely a concern
<Sync time="170.252"/>
 the other thing that we look at is we can see remember I told you there's the lateral incisor that's lingually displaced there's th- the (deciduous lateral) there's the two (bicuspids) in (crossbite) and if you look here at the frontal photo you can see that both sides look like they're going in
<Sync time="188.804"/>
 it looks like a very (constricted) (upper arch)
<Sync time="191.617"/>
 we like to see a nice broad arch we don't like to see a constricted arch again this case should have been treated earlier 
<Sync time="199.086"/>
 so we look at we look at that situation and and the other thing you have to remember is when you expand an arch you sometimes (open the bite)
<Sync time="209.642"/>
 now she's end-to-end here she's got like a 1 millimeter (overjet) and 1 millimeter (overbite) 
<Sync time="214.890"/>
 so when you expand an (arch) you have to worry about the bite opening in the (front) 
<Sync time="219.420"/>
 when you expand an arch on a class 3 and you free up the mandible and the patient still has some growth potential left then the mandible could come forward so she could come forward into a class three so this looks like a relatively easy case but you have to be aware that this could this could be a more difficult case
<Sync time="237.577"/>
 if the (bite opens) and if if the mandible comes forward then it's not an easy case so so class 3 potential cases are not easy cases 
<Sync time="249.564"/>
 and you can see she has some other interesting things happening here
<Sync time="252.58"/>
 again you can see the lateral incisors on the (palate) you can see the (deciduous laterals) in place and you can see a very constricted archs particularly area of the (bicuspids) 
<Sync time="262.999"/>
 and you can also see that that the l- the the (upper) (first bicuspids) are much larger than the upper (second bicuspids) there's quite a (tooth size discrepancy) here 
<Sync time="275.604"/>
 so look at the size of the upper first bicuspid and then the upper second bicuspid and look at the (lower) bicuspids the lower bicuspids both look normal size 
<Sync time="285.041"/>
 so again you'd have to worry that if you had a tooth size discrepancy are you going to get a proper occlusion at the end 
<Sync time="291.545"/>
 are the are the occlusion in the area of the bicuspids and the cuspids gonna be normal when you've got such a large upper first bicuspid such a small second bicuspid and then and normal size lower bicuspids 
<Sync time="304.354"/>
 I think you should mention that to the patient that you know y- you have some different (shaped) teeth that might make it difficult to get a final perfect (finish)
<Sync time="314.038"/>
 we're still gonna have your teeth straight you still gonna have a nice (smile) 
<Sync time="317.595"/>
 but maybe that the the bite won't be absolutely perfect but it'll still it'll still be able to (chew) to your food you'll still be fine but we may not be able to get a textbook finish because we don't have a proper sized teeth to start with 
<Sync time="330.527"/>
 but don't worry we'll do the best we can 
<Sync time="333.890"/>
 so with that now the (lower arch) always in class 3 you've got a (broad arch) and you can see that's a nice broad arch the other interesting thing is look at how these teeth are (rolled lingually) 
<Sync time="345.973"/>
 look at how the second bicuspid and the molars are (torqued lingually) like this
<Sync time="350.788"/>
 so you know that when we put our (straight wire) (brackets) on 
<Sync time="353.820"/>
 remember the torque on our on our bic- bicuspids and molars are minus 12
<Sync time="360.821"/>
 so the torque on our molars minus 12 so we put we put our (arch wire) into the (slot) the tooth is gonna go to minus 12
<Sync time="370.157"/>
 well if the tooth starts out in minus 35 like this 
<Sync time="376.326"/>
 tooth starts out at minus 35 and you can see those teeth are really (lingually inclined) and then you put an arch wire in there you're gonna (upright) that tooth to minus 12
<Sync time="384.55"/>
 so we're gonna get a lot of (uprighting) on the (lower arch) with our brackets 
<Sync time="390.045"/>
 pre-program brackets to upright to minus 12
<Sync time="394.992"/>
 so we're definitely gonna have to (expand) and (upright) those already in crossbite but when the lowers upright we're gonna have to expand the upper or they'll all gonna be in (buccal crossbite) 
<Sync time="403.725"/>
 so you have to consider that and look carefully to arches
<Sync time="407.856"/>
 and both sides you can see the molars and the bicuspids are definitely (lingually inclined) and the (incisor) look very (upright) 
<Sync time="415.275"/>
 or maybe slightly lingually inclined
<Sync time="418.189"/>
 so that's very common in class 3 s
<Sync time="421.017"/>
 so that's the case 
<Sync time="424.078"/>
 again very large (upper) (first bicuspid) is very small second bicuspid tooth size discrepancy
<Sync time="430.339"/>
 you need to do the (Bolton analysis) on your cases prior to (treatment) to say if you do have a tooth size discrepancy 
<Sync time="436.575"/>
 if you do you need to mention that to the patients ahead of time so their expectations for a sore so-called perfect (finish) are not there 
<Sync time="444.045"/>
 so my (treatment plan) was to use a (banded hyrax) on the upper I I like the banded hyrax it's one of my favorite (appliances) 
<Sync time="451.560"/>
 you can make it with a (memory screw) where you turn the screw or you can make with a regular her where the patient turns the screw twice a week 
<Sync time="458.700"/>
 and it consists of a (band) on the first molars and (mesial rests) on the first bicuspids and and a (hyrax screw) it's a very simple appliance and it's a very effective appliance
<Sync time="470.054"/>
 so there we have it we have the the (midline screw)
<Sync time="472.751"/>
 and you can see the arrows 
<Sync time="475.790"/>
 and we have (keys) now that have a light
<Sync time="481.466"/>
 and those keys with a light on in are excellent
<Sync time="483.97"/>
 and you need to talk to the labs and because the parents when they're trying to adjust that or or she's trying to adjust it she can't see back there
<Sync time="491.989"/>
 so we have a light
<Sync time="493.749"/>
 you can even shine the light on you can see with that
<Sync time="497.506"/>
 I I'm pointing right now to the to the opening and the screw and you put your key in that 
<Sync time="504.285"/>
 and and the arrows are going back and they'll turn it back all the way
<Sync time="508.298"/>
 you see put the key in the anterior part and turn it back and then take it out
<Sync time="511.619"/>
 and the key is on a (swivel) 
<Sync time="513.744"/>
 so get the key with a with a light
<Sync time="516.28"/>
 they're not that expensive and the lab will include that with a (appliance) 
<Sync time="519.915"/>
 and that'll make it easier for the patient to adjust that appliance and they'll need to adjust it twice a week
<Sync time="525.397"/>
 I tell them every Wednesday every Saturday every Wednesday every Saturday then they'll remember
<Sync time="530.584"/>
 so with the (cemented bands) I never gonna put (flowable composite) on the (mesial rests)
<Sync time="538.375"/>
 and remember I've told this before I like to fit my own (bands)
<Sync time="542.139"/>
 so bring the patient in one week before 
<Sync time="544.710"/>
 I put the (separators) (mesial) and (distal) to the first molars on both sides
<Sync time="548.977"/>
 bring the patient back in a week take the separators out fit the 2 bands 
<Sync time="552.870"/>
 take the band's off the teeth put them on a (cotton roll) slide the bands on a cotton roll wrap them up carefully so they won't get distorted
<Sync time="560.286"/>
 take an upper (impression) of the of the molars separated
<Sync time="564.834"/>
 poured in yellow (stone) and send the upper (model) and the two bands to the (lab) and they'll send you back the hyrax and you know it's gonna fit
<Sync time="572.249"/>
 because you fit the bands
<Sync time="574.006"/>
 if you ask the lab to fit the bands and they scrape the model sometimes the hyrax won't fit the bands won't fit th- with the patient and that's not good 
<Sync time="582.270"/>
 so we recommend that's you fit the bands plus you're gonna have your (tubes) on the (buccal)
<Sync time="586.918"/>
 so as soon as we expand we get to #* into (straight wire) and we've got our brackets on the on the teeth 
<Sync time="593.220"/>
 we want our brackets on the on the teeth with the with the proper (tip) and (torque) 
<Sync time="598.070"/>
 so there it is but don't forget to some to to bond with (flowable composite) the (mesial rests)
<Sync time="605.816"/>
 otherwise you've just got 2 teeth holding while you want (retention) of 4 teeth
<Sync time="611.459"/>
 the reason you have the rest is because this (bar) right here if you don't put the rest on the mesial besides giving it better retention that bar could dig in right here on the (palate) and cause discomfort for the patient 
<Sync time="623.220"/>
 so always use mesial rests 
<Sync time="628.284"/>
 so here's the base and now we've expanded the hyrax 4 millimeters
<Sync time="632.085"/>
 we I usually like to do the expansion first before I put the (straight wire) on it
<Sync time="636.040"/>
 'cause I find when there is more room in the arch then they the brackets come on better and the teeth aren't so sore when room for the teeth they don't hurt nearly as much when you straight them 
<Sync time="645.225"/>
 so we've expanded 4 millimeters but I wanted to see what's happening with our expansion remember I told you when you expand a case you have to think sometimes the bite will open 
<Sync time="656.175"/>
 well you can see our our patient now has got a but a [half a millimeter] (open bite) here on the (right side) 
<Sync time="663.720"/>
 and you can see that the (cuspid) now has gone into class 3 and the molar is (class 3) 
<Sync time="669.270"/>
 so what's happening is the bite is opening and the mandible is slowly coming forward a little more class 3 so that makes the case a lot more difficult 
<Sync time="678.765"/>
 so we're losing our class 1 cuspid we're losing our class 1 (molar relationship) on this side and we're opening the bite a little bit on the front and we're just getting started
<Sync time="687.246"/>
 we've only opened the hyrax screw 4 millimeters and we need more expansion 
<Sync time="692.546"/>
 now we've opened 6 millimeters 
<Sync time="696.316"/>
 but look what's happening on the on the left side
<Sync time="699.069"/>
 we started out with a slight class 3 (cuspid relationship) and now it's about 2 or 3 millimeters class 3
<Sync time="705.597"/>
 and the molar is worse now is much more class 3 than when we started 
<Sync time="709.200"/>
 so for sure the mandible because you expand the (maxilla) the mandible is coming forward a little bit 
<Sync time="714.525"/>
 possibly the mandible is trapped and the (condyle) wants to move a little bit down and forward to a more comfortable position
<Sync time="720.7"/>
 and one key would be if you did a (TMJ) evaluation of the patient and found some signs and symptoms of TMJ you would you need to expect it to happen 
<Sync time="730.725"/>
 so patients with temporomandibular joint dysfunction and you expand the (upper arch) the mandible will definitely come down and forward trying to get the condyle a more comfortable position in the (glenoid fossa) away from the (nerves) and (blood vessels)
<Sync time="743.518"/>
 the patient almost (decompresses) their own (joint) if you allow the (mandible) to have room to move to a different position 
<Sync time="750.030"/>
 so you can see this case now is is is shaping up to be a much more difficult case than we started to thought in the beginning 
<Sync time="756.630"/>
 because we've got a (class 3 cuspid) (class 3 molar)
<Sync time="760.723"/>
 now we're almost end-to-end in fact almost into an anterior crossbite here we're in there so any more movement we could go into crossbite 
<Sync time="768.945"/>
 the we extracted 1 the primary lateral on the on the on the left side 
<Sync time="775.365"/>
 and you can see the (permanent laterals) there 
<Sync time="778.315"/>
 and we've expanded about 6 millimeters now so maybe we're almost into position you can see here on the on the on the right side sorry on the left side we've extracted that primary lateral now we're gonna straight- straighten that one lateral incisor 
<Sync time="793.695"/>
 a lot my patients like the (clear brackets) 
<Sync time="797.220"/>
 well I have 2 (typodonts) actually I've 3 typodonts I've got one typodont with the Diamond brackets and the colored (ligature ties) which I show the children 
<Sync time="807.313"/>
 I've got another typodont with the clear brackets
<Sync time="810.45"/>
 and the clear brackets that I have now are called the Neolucent clear brackets 
<Sync time="814.755"/>
 I get those from Ortho Organizers in the United States and I get them from Cerum Ortho in Canada and they're excellent they're (translucent brackets) and they are really nice because you the the the true color of the tooth comes right to #* and you can hardly see the brackets
<Sync time="829.422"/>
 this was a technique that we tried for a while when we put these crosses on here 
<Sync time="834.675"/>
 but the trouble with those crosses was they only came in one color and and if you have different color teeth sometimes they look good sometimes they didn't 
<Sync time="843.005"/>
 what we're trying to do is get away from the (ligature ties) that (stain) that's the big disadvantage of the clear brackets is the ligature tie stain
<Sync time="851.761"/>
 we've got smoky and pearl 
<Sync time="854.820"/>
 two ligature ties by Ortho Organizers that don't stain as much okay so it's called pearl and smokey so those the ones we use now 
<Sync time="864.915"/>
 we've used these crosses for a while but we don't use those anymore we've found that they weren't they weren't very effective 
<Sync time="870.615"/>
 so you can see but this case had the crosses and we just put we put the brackets on cuspid to cuspid 
<Sync time="876.435"/>
 the the clear brackets are more (bulky) than the metal brackets but they look a lot better and lot of patients want them 
<Sync time="883.470"/>
 but if you can get away with just going from cuspid to cuspid with the clear brackets try that because then the metal brackets are are less bulky on the bicuspids and and a little easier on the patient's (cheek)
<Sync time="895.551"/>
 they don't they don't (protrude) as much
<Sync time="898.004"/>
 so we've just (tied that in) now with an o 1 4 [.014] (Ni Ti) (wire) that's our number 1 (leveling wire) we start most of our cases with that 
<Sync time="905.940"/>
 so with 60 (grams of force) we can (bend) it 87 degrees you won't (distort) it it's an excellent wire very light gentle continuous forces 
<Sync time="914.539"/>
 its (nickel titanium)
<Sync time="915.933"/>
 we call it Ni Ti
<Sync time="918.515"/>
 and and now we've (tied everything in) so it goes right back to the molar remember the molars got a hyrax
<Sync time="924.709"/>
 now it looks like we've (overexpanded) the upper 
<Sync time="928.511"/>
 but remember the (lower teeth) haven't haven't been (bracketed) yet and they're gonna upright with the (torque) that's built into my brackets the minus 12 torque
<Sync time="936.59"/>
 it's built in the cuspids sorry the bicuspid the molars so those teeth and upright on their own with just the wires
<Sync time="942.942"/>
 so we have to overexpand anticipating that 
<Sync time="947.763"/>
 so you can see we've (tied everything in) 
<Sync time="952.218"/>
 here it is now this is the occlusal view you've open 6 millimeters the hyrax has opened 6 millimeters
<Sync time="957.268"/>
 and you can see that the o 1 4 [.014] nickel titanium #* is tied in
<Sync time="960.491"/>
 and you can see that for sure the the clear brackets are definitely bulkier than the metal brackets
<Sync time="966.66"/>
 there is the metal bracket in the bicuspid there's the clear bracket on the on the lateral but patients don't care usually they they don't care they want the appearance 
<Sync time="975.400"/>
 they don't want the brackets that show
<Sync time="977.9"/>
 and and and I think clear brackets are vastly underrated 
<Sync time="981.967"/>
 I mean most patients don't even know about clear brackets
<Sync time="985.007"/>
 so you really should have some brochures in your (office) in your (waiting room) showing pages about clear brackets so they know by the clear brackets 
<Sync time="992.475"/>
 everybody knows about Invisalign
<Sync time="995.071"/>
 everybody knows about metal brackets
<Sync time="996.899"/>
 they don't know about clear brackets
<Sync time="998.793"/>
 and there is a lot of patients in my practice that wouldn't have (braces) unless I offer them the clear 
<Sync time="1004.055"/>
 so I always show them the clear brackets and and a lot of them want that
<Sync time="1008.578"/>
 if they want faster treatment of course we go to (self-ligating brackets) 
<Sync time="1012.322"/>
 if they want they want the fastest treatment they go (self-ligating) with (no colored) (ligature ties) if they want a little slower treatment but they want nice aesthetic result then they go with the clear 
<Sync time="1024.894"/>
 so again we haven't ti- we haven't (activated) the there's no room for this lateral on the lingual on the on the right 
<Sync time="1032.165"/>
 but over here you can see there is room for the for the lateral on the left
<Sync time="1036.13"/>
 so if there's the room for the lateral on the left we (tie in) the left lateral but the right lateral we're gonna leave for a while and then we have to put an (open coil) in there to make space for that too
<Sync time="1045.764"/>
 @void
<Sync time="1049.420"/>
 so again this tooth is lingually displaced here
<Sync time="1052.849"/>
 and you can see now it's tied in and it's it's it's looking good 
<Sync time="1058.036"/>
 okay so it probably took about 2 months we have to tie in that tooth 3 at the most to get that tooth into position 
<Sync time="1064.415"/>
 now the hyrax is open 10 millimeters
<Sync time="1067.609"/>
 lots of expansion 'cause remember those lowers we wanna upright we want a nice broad smile 
<Sync time="1072.832"/>
 and now we've got an open coil over here to make room for the (right lateral incisor) so (left lateral incisor) is in line now we're gonna put an open coil in here to try to make room for the right lateral incisor we don't wanna tied it in until there's room 
<Sync time="1089.206"/>
 so there we have it
<Sync time="1090.374"/>
 the patient now has to be in a (working wire) remember we (lined up) the left lateral with a with a (leveling wire) the o 1 4 Ni Ti
<Sync time="1099.661"/>
 now that the tooth is lined up and you can see it there's the tooth nicely lined up the left lateral is in position
<Sync time="1106.012"/>
 now what we wanna do we want to make room for the right lateral 
<Sync time="1109.250"/>
 so I put a piece of open coil on
<Sync time="1112.227"/>
 remember we measure from the mesial of the cuspid the bracket on the cuspid to the distal of the bracket on the on the (central) and say that's say that's 10 millimeters
<Sync time="1123.08"/>
 so you got 10 plus 4 it's 14 millimeters
<Sync time="1125.73"/>
 you cut a piece of open coil of 14 millimeter slide it on the (arch wire) and then compress it 
<Sync time="1131.735"/>
 tie it in and then it tries to do that with a compressed coil of 14 the space is only 10 as soon as you take off the as soon as you tie in the brackets it wants to do this and so that will slowly make space 
<Sync time="1144.080"/>
 don't use more than 4 or you might cause rotation of the teeth in the end
<Sync time="1149.274"/>
 and you're trying to prevent rotation not cause rotations 
<Sync time="1151.65"/>
@void
<Sync time="1153.641"/>
 so we're just gonna change that every month the patient comes in you measure the space at 4 millimeters cut new piece of open coil and put in there it might take 3 months to make the space 
<Sync time="1163.115"/>
 and we must be in a (working wire) 
<Sync time="1166.220"/>
 it's got 2 working wires
<Sync time="1168.703"/>
 you've got the o 1 8 [.018] CNA which is 280 grams or you've got the 19 25 [19x25] V 4 3 [V4 3] which is a hundred 2 hundred and 3 hundred grams 
<Sync time="1179.825"/>
 V 4 means variable force 3 force levels into one wire 
<Sync time="1185.971"/>
 but now we've got the o 1 8 Ni T- o 1 8 CNA in the upper and in the bottom we're just starting to line the teeth up so we've got the o 1 8 Ni Ti at the bottom
<Sync time="1196.756"/>
 now if the if the teeth are pretty straight which the lower ones were we can start with an o 1 8 Ni Ti
<Sync time="1203.45"/>
 if the teeth were crooked or if the patient was really very sensitive teeth I would start with an o 1 4 [.014] Ni Ti but when the teeth are pretty (straight) we start with an o 1 8 Ni Ti #* about 80 grams of force which is which is very (light gentle forces)

 the other thing you have to worry about is when you put the brackets on a class 3 case and there's and there's any (crowding) in the lower the lower incisors will (flare) 
<Sync time="1225.995"/>
 and you'll cause more of an (anterior crossbite) which you don't want
<Sync time="1230.800"/>
 so you can see my bite is opening my bite is opening more
<Sync time="1235.065"/>
 I've got a 1 millimeter (anterior open bite) over here 
<Sync time="1238.805"/>
 I've got my cuspid still class 3
<Sync time="1241.721"/>
 I've got my molar class 3
<Sync time="1243.322"/>
 I've got my (separators) in down here to put a (molar band) on that lower molar 
<Sync time="1248.435"/>
 but my case is getting more difficult isn't it
<Sync time="1251.491"/>
 I mean we're we are developing an anterior open bite 
<Sync time="1255.185"/>
 where where where the mandible is coming forward I've got a class 3 cuspid class 3 molar
<Sync time="1259.617"/>
 this is a more difficult case to treat
