thanks  O
everybody  O
for  O
coming  O

   
i  O
just  O
wanna  O
say  O
i've  B-MISC
been  O
coming  O
to  O
these  O
things  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
i  B-MISC
missed  O
the  O
first  O
one  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
my  O
favorite  O
place  O
in  O
the  O
world  O
to  O
be  O
and  O
it's  O
really  O
because  O
of  O
you  O
guys  O
so  O
let's  O
give  O
you  O
guys  O
a  O
big  O
hand  O

   
alright  O
so  O
we  O
#*  O
there's  O
two  O
of  O
us  O
talking  O
so  O
there's  O
not  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
time  O
so  O
we're  O
gonna  O
do  O
like  O
little  O
ted  B-MISC
talks  I-MISC
hopefully  O
mine  O
doesn't  O
turn  O
into  O
a  O
ted  B-MISC
geisel  I-MISC
talk  O

   
for  O
those  O
of  O
you  O
know  O
don't  O
know  O
who  O
that  O
is  O
is  O
doctor  O
seuss  B-MISC

   
so  O
okay  O
first  O
of  O
all  O
our  O
friend  O
al  B-MISC
danenberg  I-MISC
he  O
been  O
ill  O
he  O
would  O
have  O
loved  O
to  O
be  O
here  O
he  O
can't  O
make  O
it  O

   
so  O
you  O
know  O
our  O
hearts  O
and  O
prayers  O
are  O
are  O
with  O
him  O

   
i  O
just  O
wanted  O
to  O
start  O
by  O
saying  O
you  O
know  O
he  O
was  O
kind  O
of  O
my  O
inspiration  O
for  O
what  O
i'm  B-MISC
talking  O
about  O
today  O

   
so  O
currently  O
were  O
doing  O
a  O
study  O
designed  O
by  O
doctor  O
al  B-MISC

   
its  O
a  O
we're  O
gonna  O
look  O
for  O
50  O
subjects  O
with  O
measurable  O
gum  O
disease  O

   
we're  O
going  O
to  O
do  O
swabs  O
actually  O
mitoswabs  B-MISC
to  O
check  O
their  O
mitochondrial  O
function  O
and  O
oral  O
microbiome  O
swabs  O
as  O
well  O

   
6  O
weeks  O
of  O
either  O
a  O
placebo  O
or  O
a  O
probiotic  O
with  O
vitamin  O
k2  B-MISC
double  O
check  O
the  O
inflammation  O
and  O
also  O
the  O
mitocon-  O
mitochondrial  O
function  O
and  O
the  O
oral  O
microbiome  O

   
we  O
suspect  O
we're  O
gonna  O
see  O
changes  O
in  O
the  O
mitochondrial  O
function  O

   
and  O
the  O
oral  O
microbiome  O
is  O
probably  O
going  O
to  O
change  O
because  O
we're  O
affecting  O
the  O
gi  B-MISC
microbiome  O
so  O
that's  O
sort  O
of  O
the  O
incentive  O
for  O
what  O
i'm  B-MISC
gonna  O
talk  O
about  O
today  O

   
alright  O
that's  O
my  O
fake  O
book  O
i  B-MISC
haven't  O
written  O
that  O
carb  O
mouth  O
maybe  O
one  O
day  O

   
so  O
the  O
two  O
things  O
that  O
i'm  B-MISC
gonna  O
talk  O
about  O
today  O
we're  O
gonna  O
do  O
an  O
examination  O
of  O
the  O
relationship  O
between  O
the  O
oral  O
and  O
general  O
gut  O
dysbiosis  O
both  O
of  O
which  O
seemed  O
to  O
be  O
initiated  O
by  O
the  O
introduction  O
of  O
dense  O
acellular  O
carbohydrates  O

   
and  O
then  O
i'm  B-MISC
gonna  O
get  O
into  O
an  O
explora-  O
an  O
exploration  O
of  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
critical  O
factors  O
in  O
the  O
etiology  O
of  O
caries  O
and  O
periodontitis  O

   
okay  O
so  O
23  O
centuries  O
ago  O
aristotle  B-MISC
tried  O
to  O
describe  O
foods  O
that  O
caused  O
cavities  O

   
and  O
then  O
you  O
look  O
down  O
at  O
the  O
guy  O
in  O
the  O
bottom  O
and  O
that's  O
about  O
where  O
we've  O
gotten  O

   
it's  O
still  O
very  O
very  O
confusing  O

   
here  O
is  O
an  O
example  O
if  O
you  O
look  O
at  O
the  O
foods  O
on  O
the  O
right  O
you  O
know  O
which  O
one  O
of  O
those  O
is  O
actually  O
gonna  O
cause  O
more  O
cavities  O

   
is  O
it  O
the  O
lollipop  O
with  O
all  O
the  O
sugar  O
or  O
is  O
it  O
the  O
pretzel  O

   
and  O
there  O
are  O
factors  O
that  O
i  B-MISC
would  O
say  O
both  O
cause  O
cavities  O
but  O
one  O
might  O
be  O
worse  O
than  O
the  O
other  O
and  O
it's  O
kind  O
of  O
a  O
mystery  O

   
and  O
we'll  O
get  O
into  O
that  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O
later  O

   
so  O
here's  O
the  O
general  O
formula  O
okay  O

   
we  O
have  O
fermentable  O
carbohydrates  O
plus  O
cariogenic  O
mouth  O
bacteria  O
so  O
cariogenic  O
just  O
means  O
cavity  O
causing  O
and  O
susceptible  O
teeth  O
and  O
then  O
that  O
gets  O
you  O
your  O
risk  O
for  O
cavities  O

   
that's  O
really  O
a  O
bit  O
of  O
an  O
oversimplification  O
so  O
throughout  O
this  O
little  O
presentation  O
i'm  B-MISC
gonna  O
be  O
clarifying  O
that  O

   
okay  O
so  O
this  O
is  O
where  O
we're  O
gonna  O
end  O
up  O
with  O
i'm  B-MISC
not  O
gonna  O
keep  O
the  O
slide  O
up  O
there  O
for  O
too  O
long  O
and  O
come  O
back  O
to  O
it  O
reconstruct  O
it  O
later  O
on  O

   
alright  O
so  O
fermentable  O
carbohydrates  O

   
all  O
carbohydrates  O
are  O
fermentable  O
okay  O

   
they  O
can  O
all  O
be  O
metabolized  O
for  O
energy  O
by  O
microorganisms  O

   
so  O
we've  O
been  O
on  O
this  O
planet  O
for  O
3  O
million  O
years  O
or  O
so  O

   
we've  O
only  O
just  O
recently  O
gotten  O
cavities  O
and  O
we've  O
been  O
eating  O
fermentable  O
carbohydrates  O
for  O
a  O
long  O
time  O
so  O
that's  O
incorrect  O

   
okay  O
whole  O
foods  O
it's  O
interesting  O
that  O
have  O
a  O
picture  O
of  O
of  O
an  O
acorn  O

   
you  O
don't  O
think  O
of  O
people  O
as  O
eating  O
acorns  O
but  O
we  O
see  O
squirrels  O
eating  O
them  O
all  O
the  O
time  O

   
and  O
if  O
you  O
look  O
at  O
that  O
thing  O
there's  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
wood  O
in  O
there  O
as  O
they  O
got  O
to  O
get  O
through  O
the  O
wood  O
in  O
order  O
to  O
get  O
to  O
the  O
carbohydrate  O
inside  O

   
so  O
arguably  O
a  O
diet  O
that's  O
a  O
whole  O
foods  O
diet  O
it's  O
gonna  O
be  O
much  O
better  O
for  O
you  O

   
and  O
i  B-MISC
have  O
a  O
study  O
down  O
there  O
that  O
if  O
you're  O
kind  O
of  O
curious  O
i  B-MISC
have  O
it  O

   
you  O
can  O
refer  O
to  O
that  O
or  O
you  O
can  O
read  O
this  O
book  O
tyron  B-MISC
finds  O
corn  O
in  O
his  O
#*  O

   
that's  O
pretty  O
good  O
explanation  O
right  O
there  O

   
you  O
wrap  O
stuff  O
up  O
in  O
cellulose  O
it's  O
hard  O
to  O
break  O
down  O
we  O
don't  O
get  O
a  O
sugar  O
bomb  O
in  O
our  O
mouth  O

   
okay  O
so  O
dense  O
acellular  O
carbohydrate  O
right  O
this  O
is  O
what  O
we're  O
looking  O
at  O
sugar  O
all  O
that  O
sort  O
of  O
stuff  O
by  O
studying  O
how  O
ultra-processing  O
changes  O
the  O
properties  O
of  O
whole  O
foods  O
and  O
how  O
these  O
foods  O
affect  O
the  O
gut  O
microbiome  O
more  O
useful  O
dietary  O
guidelines  O
can  O
be  O
made  O

   
and  O
for  O
those  O
of  O
you  O
who  O
don't  O
know  O
what  O
dense  O
acellular  O
carbohydrates  O
are  O
there's  O
some  O
of  O
them  O

   
doesn't  O
have  O
to  O
just  O
be  O
wheat  O
flour  O
could  O
be  O
tapioca  O
starch  O

   
anytime  O
you  O
take  O
the  O
carbs  O
outside  O
of  O
a  O
plant  O
cell  O
it's  O
a  O
dangerous  O
thing  O

   
okay  O
so  O
plaque  O
acid  O
dense  O
acellular  O
carbohydrate  O
and  O
tooth  O
decay  O

   
the  O
mechanism  O
is  O
is  O
this  O
you  O
get  O
the  O
acellular  O
carbohydrates  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O

   
the  O
bacteria  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O
ferment  O
the  O
stuff  O

   
it  O
lowers  O
the  O
ph  O
and  O
the  O
ph  O
dissolves  O
the  O
minerals  O
in  O
the  O
teeth  O
it's  O
that  O
simple  O

   
@void  O

   
and  O
when  O
we're  O
talking  O
about  O
gum  O
disease  O
you  O
have  O
plaque  O
making  O
lipopolysaccharides  O
from  O
the  O
dense  O
acellular  O
carbohydrates  O
and  O
you  O
get  O
gum  O
disease  O

   
lipopolysaccharides  O
are  O
also  O
known  O
as  O
endotoxins  O
okay  O
so  O
on  O
a  O
local  O
level  O
they're  O
toxic  O
to  O
the  O
gums  O

   
and  O
this  O
is  O
with  O
the  O
introduction  O
of  O
dense  O
acellular  O
carbohydrates  O

   
endotoxins  O

   
okay  O
so  O
humans  O
are  O
quite  O
unique  O
primates  O
and  O
lagomorphs  O
those  O
those  O
are  O
like  O
hares  O
and  O
rabbits  O
do  O
have  O
salivary  O
amylase  O
but  O
humans  O
have  O
multiple  O
copies  O

   
okay  O
some  O
people  O
have  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
2  O
copies  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
you  O
can  O
have  O
up  O
to  O
about  O
15  O

   
so  O
when  O
you're  O
eating  O
that  O
pretzel  O
okay  O
we've  O
all  O
done  O
this  O
you  O
can't  O
touch  O
your  O
teeth  O
together  O
for  O
for  O
sometimes  O
20  O
minutes  O
to  O
1  O
hour  O
because  O
there's  O
there's  O
all  O
that  O
doughy  O
stuff  O
stuck  O
to  O
your  O
teeth  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
the  O
the  O
starch  O
and  O
flowers  O
amylopectin  O
if  O
i'm  B-MISC
not  O
mistaken  O
and  O
that's  O
considered  O
to  O
be  O
a  O
lower  O
cariogenetic  O
substance  O
however  O
it  O
stays  O
there  O
for  O
a  O
long  O
time  O
and  O
now  O
your  O
saliva  O
and  O
especially  O
if  O
you  O
have  O
more  O
amylase  O
you  O
used  O
to  O
call  O
it  O
ptyalin  O
you're  O
gonna  O
be  O
breaking  O
that  O
stuff  O
down  O
into  O
simple  O
sugars  O

   
so  O
what's  O
worse  O
a  O
lollipop  O
that  O
maybe  O
sticks  O
to  O
your  O
teeth  O
but  O
it  O
melts  O
off  O
pretty  O
quickly  O
or  O
maybe  O
a  O
pretzel  O
that  O
stays  O
there  O
for  O
a  O
long  O
time  O
these  O
are  O
interesting  O
questions  O

   
so  O
more  O
amylase  O
does  O
equal  O
more  O
sugar  O
okay  O
we've  O
#*  O
scott  O
touched  O
upon  O
that  O

   
so  O
basically  O
you  O
know  O
salivary  O
amylase  O
becomes  O
a  O
problem  O
when  O
we  O
eat  O
that  O
processed  O
carbohydrates  O

   
so  O
even  O
if  O
they're  O
complex  O
carbohydrates  O
they  O
can  O
become  O
simple  O
sugars  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O

   
the  O
bacteria  O
can  O
actually  O
hijack  O
the  O
amylase  O
to  O
help  O
to  O
get  O
more  O
sugar  O
from  O
the  O
starch  O

   
and  O
they  O
also  O
use  O
it  O
sort  O
of  O
as  O
a  O
matrix  O
to  O
develop  O
the  O
biofilm  O

   
and  O
and  O
also  O
the  O
bacteria  O
do  O
make  O
their  O
own  O
amylase  O
as  O
well  O

   
so  O
all  O
of  O
this  O
stuff  O
causes  O
a  O
lowering  O
of  O
the  O
ph  O
an  O
acidic  O
environment  O
and  O
basically  O
melting  O
away  O
of  O
the  O
teeth  O

   
okay  O
so  O
weston  B-MISC
a.  I-MISC
price  I-MISC
okay  O
john  B-MISC
yudkin  I-MISC
thomas  I-MISC
l.  I-MISC
cleave  I-MISC
these  O
are  O
all  O
sort  O
of  O
pioneers  O
that  O
spoke  O
about  O
the  O
introduction  O
of  O
modern  O
foods  O
and  O
you  O
know  O
what  O
it  O
did  O
to  O
all  O
of  O
us  O
so  O
you  O
know  O
you  O
see  O
that  O
guy  O
on  O
the  O
bottom  O
there  O
with  O
all  O
of  O
his  O
tattoos  O
but  O
if  O
he  O
didn't  O
have  O
his  O
tattoos  O
his  O
fleshiness  O
is  O
giving  O
away  O
what  O
really  O
what  O
he's  O
doing  O
isn't  O
it  O

   
that's  O
another  O
way  O
of  O
putting  O
it  O
forrest  B-MISC
gump  I-MISC
was  O
pretty  O
smart  O

   
but  O
to  O
get  O
technical  O
and  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
mechanisms  O
that  O
go  O
on  O
this  O
just  O
happens  O
to  O
be  O
one  O

   
so  O
basically  O
de  B-MISC
lartigue  I-MISC
was  O
a  O
bit  O
of  O
more  O
elaborate  O
in  O
in  O
implicating  O
the  O
vagus  O
nerve  O
leptin  O
resistance  O
blunting  O
you  O
know  O
the  O
satiety  O
and  O
they're  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
mechanisms  O
and  O
we  O
just  O
i  B-MISC
don't  O
have  O
enough  O
time  O
to  O
really  O
get  O
into  O
that  O
today  O
okay  O

   
so  O
the  O
present  O
hypothesis  O
suggests  O
that  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
diet  O
of  O
high  O
density  O
carbohydrates  O
that  O
produce  O
inflammatory  O
microbiotal  O
changes  O
in  O
both  O
the  O
mouth  O
and  O
the  O
gut  O

   
when  O
i  B-MISC
was  O
putting  O
together  O
this  O
presentation  O
i  B-MISC
was  O
maybe  O
put  O
a  O
picture  O
of  O
the  O
gut  O

   
and  O
it's  O
interesting  O
half  O
of  O
the  O
pictures  O
you  O
pull  O
up  O
start  O
here  O
they  O
don't  O
include  O
the  O
mouth  O
and  O
it's  O
amazing  O
to  O
me  O

   
we  O
already  O
talked  O
about  O
salivary  O
amylase  O
or  O
breaking  O
down  O
carbohydrates  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O
we're  O
digesting  O
right  O
here  O
okay  O

   
so  O
when  O
you  O
start  O
with  O
this  O
dysbiosis  O
of  O
the  O
mouth  O
with  O
the  O
introduction  O
of  O
dense  O
acellular  O
carbohydrates  O
you're  O
gonna  O
get  O
inflammation  O
of  O
the  O
gums  O
you're  O
gonna  O
get  O
your  O
teeth  O
melting  O
away  O

   
what  O
happens  O
to  O
the  O
food  O
after  O
you  O
swallow  O
it  O

   
last  O
time  O
i  B-MISC
checked  O
it  O
goes  O
down  O
somewhere  O
and  O
it  O
stays  O
in  O
your  O
body  O
for  O
a  O
long  O
time  O

   
so  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
definite  O
change  O
in  O
the  O
microbiome  O
of  O
the  O
gut  O

   
some  O
people  O
argue  O
the  O
gut  O
microbiome  O
changes  O
first  O
some  O
people  O
argue  O
the  O
mouth  O
microbiome  O
changes  O
first  O
chicken  O
or  O
the  O
egg  O
i  B-MISC
don't  O
know  O
to  O
me  O
it  O
doesn't  O
really  O
seem  O
that  O
important  O

   
but  O
to  O
me  O
when  O
you  O
introduce  O
this  O
dysbiosis  O
to  O
your  O
mouth  O
rest  O
assured  O
excuse  O
me  O
it's  O
in  O
your  O
gut  O
and  O
this  O
little  O
diagram  O
i  B-MISC
had  O
to  O
pencil  O
in  O
the  O
gum  O
disease  O
it  O
wasn't  O
even  O
on  O
there  O
people  O
just  O
seem  O
to  O
forget  O
about  O
the  O
mouth  O

   
but  O
all  O
of  O
these  O
things  O
occur  O
these  O
are  O
low  O
levels  O
of  O
chronic  O
inflammation  O
that  O
we  O
have  O
in  O
our  O
bodies  O
because  O
of  O
dense  O
acellular  O
carbohydrate  O
changing  O
microbiome  O

   
okay  O
so  O
here  O
we  O
go  O
dysbiosis  O
of  O
the  O
gut  O
pretty  O
much  O
means  O
dysbiosis  O
of  O
the  O
oral  O
cavity  O

   
the  O
present  O
hypothesis  O
suggests  O
that  O
in  O
parallel  O
with  O
bacterial  O
effects  O
of  O
sugars  O
on  O
dental  O
and  O
periodontal  O
health  O
acellular  O
flowers  O
sugars  O
and  O
processed  O
foods  O
produce  O
an  O
inflammatory  O
microbiota  O
via  O
the  O
upper  O
gastrointestinal  O
tract  O

   
that  O
was  O
said  O
by  O
our  O
friend  O
doctor  O
ian  B-MISC
spreadbury  I-MISC
maybe  O
3  O
or  O
4  O
years  O
ago  O
i  B-MISC
don't  O
know  O
if  O
any  O
of  O
you  O
guys  O
saw  O
that  O
lecture  O
go  O
back  O
to  O
it  O
it's  O
worth  O
watching  O

   
it's  O
on  O
youtube  B-MISC
i  I-MISC
believe  O

   
okay  O
so  O
now  O
i'm  B-MISC
gonna  O
go  O
through  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
studies  O
and  O
there's  O
really  O
not  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
research  O
out  O
there  O
and  O
it's  O
really  O
kind  O
of  O
all  O
over  O
the  O
place  O

   
i'm  O
gonna  O
go  O
through  O
a  O
few  O
studies  O
that  O
are  O
gonna  O
connect  O
the  O
oral  O
oral  O
microbiome  O
with  O
gut  O
dysbiosis  O

   
so  O
in  O
this  O
study  O
here  O
they  O
did  O
a  O
bacterial  O
analysis  O
of  O
obese  O
women  O
and  O
98  O
point  O
4  O
percent  O
of  O
them  O
this  O
the  O
oral  O
microbiome  O
ha-  O
just  O
the  O
presence  O
of  O
one  O
bacteria  O
at  O
levels  O
greater  O
than  O
1  O
point  O
05  O
percent  O
of  O
the  O
total  O
bacterial  O
colony  O
was  O
indicative  O
of  O
obesity  O

   
so  O
i  B-MISC
mean  O
that's  O
close  O
to  O
a  O
100  O
percent  O

   
they  O
could  O
find  O
one  O
germ  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O
and  O
predict  O
whether  O
the  O
person  O
was  O
obese  O
so  O
that's  O
pretty  O
good  O

   
and  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
more  O
research  O
needs  O
to  O
be  O
done  O
excuse  O
me  O
along  O
these  O
lines  O

   
we  O
may  O
be  O
able  O
to  O
determine  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
things  O
just  O
by  O
a  O
simple  O
oral  O
swab  O
it's  O
really  O
easy  O
to  O
do  O

   
you  O
know  O
an  O
oral  O
microbiome  O
swab  O
test  O
it's  O
a  O
heck  O
of  O
a  O
lot  O
easier  O
than  O
a  O
stool  O
test  O
i  B-MISC
assure  O
you  O
anybody  O
here  O
ever  O
do  O
a  O
stool  O
test  O

   
not  O
so  O
much  O
fun  O

   
okay  O
two  O
more  O
studies  O

   
results  O
find  O
that  O
oral  O
buccal  O
so  O
that's  O
the  O
cheek  O
microbiome  O
reflects  O
differences  O
in  O
the  O
microbial  O
ecology  O
of  O
participants  O
with  O
ibs  B-MISC
that  O
are  O
overweight  O

   
okay  O
so  O
they  O
could  O
find  O
patterns  O
of  O
overweight  O
people  O
with  O
ibs  B-MISC
in  O
the  O
mouth  O

   
the  O
second  O
one  O
the  O
one  O
in  O
the  O
bottom  O
there  O

   
mounting  O
evidence  O
supports  O
a  O
major  O
role  O
of  O
the  O
systemic  O
spread  O
of  O
oral  O
commensals  O
and  O
pathogens  O
to  O
distant  O
body  O
sites  O
causing  O
extra-oral  O
infections  O
and  O
inflammation  O

   
what  O
does  O
that  O
mean  O

   
so  O
the  O
the  O
germs  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O
are  O
getting  O
into  O
the  O
body  O
so  O
you  O
know  O
we're  O
led  O
to  O
believe  O
that  O
the  O
stomach  O
acid  O
is  O
supposed  O
to  O
be  O
high  O
enough  O
to  O
kill  O
all  O
of  O
the  O
germs  O

   
maybe  O
maybe  O
not  O

   
i  O
think  O
that  O
s-  O
excuse  O
me  O
some  O
of  O
them  O
do  O
get  O
through  O

   
but  O
there  O
are  O
other  O
ways  O
that  O
these  O
critters  O
can  O
get  O
through  O

   
if  O
you've  O
ever  O
seen  O
severe  O
gum  O
disease  O
the  O
the  O
the  O
gums  O
are  O
just  O
bloody  O
and  O
not  O
looking  O
too  O
good  O

   
so  O
really  O
what  O
you  O
have  O
from  O
this  O
oral  O
dysbiosis  O
is  O
is  O
a  O
leaky  O
mouth  O
okay  O

   
so  O
that's  O
a  O
way  O
that  O
the  O
lipopolysaccharides  O
by  O
the  O
way  O
are  O
gonna  O
get  O
into  O
the  O
bloodstream  O
right  O
from  O
the  O
mouth  O

   
and  O
now  O
you  O
got  O
low  O
levels  O
of  O
chronic  O
inflammation  O
throughout  O
the  O
body  O

   
and  O
you're  O
sick  O

   
i  O
think  O
i've  B-MISC
got  O
1  O
or  O
2  O
more  O

   
okay  O
so  O
this  O
was  O
in  O
pediatric  O
crohn's  B-MISC
disease  O
patients  O
and  O
this  O
one  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O
more  O
general  O
they  O
just  O
found  O
that  O
there  O
was  O
a  O
decrease  O
in  O
the  O
diversity  O
of  O
the  O
oral  O
microbiome  O
in  O
this  O
particular  O
patients  O

   
and  O
then  O
one  O
more  O
in  O
mice  O

   
they  O
observed  O
that  O
mice  O
that  O
had  O
colitis  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
they  O
induced  O
it  O
the  O
composition  O
of  O
the  O
bacteria  O
present  O
in  O
the  O
oral  O
cavity  O
and  O
saliva  O
changed  O
as  O
well  O

   
okay  O
so  O
we're  O
we're  O
seeing  O
a  O
pattern  O
here  O
where  O
we  O
can  O
see  O
changes  O
in  O
the  O
bacteria  O
of  O
the  O
mouth  O
as  O
they  O
pertain  O
to  O
disease  O
states  O
so  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
there's  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
work  O
that  O
needs  O
to  O
be  O
done  O
here  O
but  O
this  O
is  O
really  O
really  O
really  O
promising  O

   
so  O
this  O
is  O
kind  O
of  O
my  O
little  O
pipe  O
dream  O

   
you  O
know  O
for  O
oral  O
microbia-  O
microbial  O
analysis  O

   
could  O
it  O
be  O
a  O
proxy  O
for  O
a  O
stool  O
test  O

   
wouldn't  O
that  O
be  O
nice  O

   
a  O
proxy  O
to  O
determine  O
whether  O
you  O
have  O
other  O
systemic  O
diseases  O

   
early  O
detection  O
of  O
gut  O
dysbiosis  O
before  O
it  O
happens  O

   
and  O
of  O
course  O
maybe  O
even  O
if  O
we  O
find  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
germs  O
in  O
there  O
maybe  O
it's  O
gonna  O
determine  O
that  O
you  O
have  O
some  O
kind  O
of  O
gum  O
disease  O
or  O
cavity  O
if  O
you  O
don't  O
watch  O
out  O

   
so  O
that's  O
pretty  O
cool  O
stuff  O

   
@void  O

   
love  O
yoda  B-MISC

   
okay  O
so  O
back  O
to  O
my  O
formula  O

   
so  O
we  O
went  O
over  O
fermentable  O
carbohydrates  O
it's  O
really  O
dense  O
acellular  O
carbohydrates  O
in  O
my  O
opinion  O
excuse  O
me  O

   
so  O
the  O
cariogenic  O
mouth  O
bacteria  O

   
i  O
also  O
have  O
a  O
problem  O
with  O
that  O
because  O
we  O
all  O
have  O
cariogenic  O
bacteria  O
in  O
our  O
mouths  O
right  O
now  O

   
but  O
we  O
all  O
aren't  O
getting  O
cavities  O
right  O
now  O
so  O
that's  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O
incorrect  O

   
and  O
and  O
here  O
is  O
a  O
little  O
proof  O
so  O
you  O
cannot  O
inherit  O
cavity  O
causing  O
germs  O
from  O
your  O
parents  O

   
we  O
know  O
this  O
this  O
has  O
been  O
discussed  O
a  O
thousand  O
times  O
at  O
the  O
ahs  B-MISC
over  O
the  O
years  O

   
that  O
you  O
know  O
when  O
you  O
go  O
through  O
the  O
birth  O
canal  O
you  O
get  O
inundated  O
with  O
your  O
mom's  O
germs  O

   
so  O
yeah  O
most  O
of  O
us  O
get  O
our  O
oral  O
microbiome  O
from  O
our  O
mothers  O
and  O
fathers  O
but  O
they  O
can  O
have  O
mouths  O
riddled  O
with  O
tooth  O
decay  O
and  O
that's  O
not  O
necessarily  O
what  O
happens  O
with  O
the  O
kids  O
okay  O

   
so  O
they  O
did  O
a  O
twin  O
study  O
here  O
and  O
what  O
they  O
really  O
determined  O
it's  O
it's  O
the  O
oral  O
environment  O
later  O
on  O
okay  O

   
so  O
germs  O
become  O
cariogenic  O
cavity  O
causing  O
because  O
you  O
change  O
their  O
environment  O
which  O
changes  O
their  O
behavior  O

   
the  O
analogy  O
that  O
i  B-MISC
like  O
to  O
use  O
is  O
you  O
know  O
we  O
all  O
have  O
probably  O
a  O
good  O
friend  O
or  O
two  O
they're  O
as  O
nice  O
as  O
p-  O
excuse  O
me  O
as  O
nice  O
as  O
pie  O
and  O
then  O
they  O
get  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
drinks  O
and  O
in  O
a  O
minute  O
get  O
real  O
angry  O
right  O

   
so  O
yeah  O
give  O
them  O
the  O
wrong  O
substrate  O
and  O
their  O
behavior  O
changed  O

   
and  O
then  O
you  O
know  O
as  O
pertains  O
to  O
gum  O
disease  O

   
i'm  O
gonna  O
get  O
a  O
little  O
more  O
involved  O
with  O
this  O
in  O
a  O
minute  O
but  O
none  O
of  O
our  O
paleolithic  O
ancestors  O
had  O
tooth  O
decay  O
or  O
gum  O
disease  O
we  O
know  O
this  O
because  O
there  O
are  O
thousands  O
and  O
thousands  O
of  O
fossilized  O
skulls  O
that  O
we  O
have  O
available  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
kevin  B-MISC
is  O
gonna  O
be  O
probably  O
talk  O
more  O
about  O
that  O
later  O

   
but  O
we  O
can  O
study  O
tartar  O
and  O
plaque  O
that's  O
thousands  O
of  O
years  O
old  O
paleo-microbiology  O
it's  O
kind  O
of  O
a  O
cool  O
thing  O

   
they  O
can  O
actually  O
go  O
in  O
there  O
and  O
and  O
look  O
at  O
the  O
dna  B-MISC
and  O
and  O
figure  O
out  O
what  O
the  O
bacterial  O
colonies  O
we  O
had  O
in  O
our  O
mouths  O
years  O
and  O
years  O
and  O
years  O
ago  O

   
so  O
they  O
found  O
two  O
changes  O

   
the  O
first  O
one  O
was  O
ten  O
thousand  O
years  O
ago  O
when  O
we  O
started  O
farming  O
and  O
that's  O
some  O
pretty  O
good  O
dentistry  O
over  O
there  O
for  O
however  O
many  O
thousands  O
of  O
years  O
ago  O
that  O
would  O
be  O
considered  O
prosthetic  O
dentistry  O
for  O
its  O
day  O
it's  O
pretty  O
good  O

   
but  O
when  O
we  O
started  O
taking  O
carbohydrates  O
out  O
of  O
the  O
cell  O
that's  O
what  O
we  O
did  O
when  O
we  O
started  O
farming  O
we  O
introduced  O
the  O
dense  O
acellular  O
carbohydrates  O
into  O
our  O
bodies  O

   
and  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
result  O

   
so  O
what  O
they  O
saw  O
was  O
that  O
there  O
was  O
an  O
uptick  O
of  O
strep  O
mutants  O
that's  O
one  O
that  O
c-  O
that  O
creates  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
acid  O

   
the  O
second  O
change  O
was  O
during  O
the  O
industrial  B-MISC
revolution  I-MISC
because  O
we  O
further  O
processed  O
flowers  O
and  O
we  O
added  O
sugars  O

   
and  O
you  O
know  O
this  O
is  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
sufferers  O
he  O
had  O
to  O
get  O
one  O
tooth  O
and  O
and  O
his  O
dentures  O
were  O
not  O
wooden  O
by  O
the  O
way  O

   
okay  O
i  B-MISC
got  O
to  O
rush  O
i  B-MISC
have  O
one  O
minute  O
left  O
okay  O
susceptible  O
teeth  O

   
we  O
all  O
have  O
susceptible  O
teeth  O
anybody  O
can  O
get  O
a  O
cavity  O
anywhere  O
anyhow  O

   
yes  O
some  O
people  O
do  O
have  O
stronger  O
teeth  O
than  O
others  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
never  O
a  O
factor  O
in  O
the  O
paleolithic  B-MISC
era  O

   
our  O
teeth  O
are  O
plenty  O
strong  O
enough  O
if  O
we  O
don't  O
put  O
this  O
stuff  O
in  O
our  O
bodies  O
okay  O
couple  O
other  O
things  O

   
frequency  O
how  O
often  O
this  O
stuff  O
gets  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O
is  O
very  O
important  O

   
frequency  O
and  O
sequence  O
so  O
baby  O
bottle  O
decay  O
everybody  O
know  O
what  O
that  O
is  O

   
you  O
can  O
take  O
very  O
watered-down  O
juice  O
or  O
even  O
milk  O
and  O
lactose  O
is  O
actually  O
very  O
low  O
on  O
the  O
cariogenic  O
scale  O

   
but  O
if  O
the  O
baby  O
is  O
suckling  O
that  O
thing  O
all  O
night  O
long  O
within  O
weeks  O
there  O
will  O
be  O
no  O
teeth  O
left  O

   
it's  O
it's  O
unbelievable  O

   
okay  O
and  O
then  O
retention  O
we  O
talk  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O
about  O
that  O
before  O
when  O
stuff  O
sticks  O
to  O
your  O
teeth  O

   
it's  O
able  O
to  O
be  O
broken  O
down  O
by  O
our  O
salivary  O
amylase  O
and  O
also  O
it's  O
just  O
there  O
as  O
a  O
substrate  O
for  O
the  O
bacteria  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O
to  O
do  O
their  O
dirty  O
work  O
okay  O

   
before  O
when  O
i  B-MISC
showed  O
you  O
other  O
different  O
things  O
ranging  O
from  O
candies  O
i  B-MISC
don't  O
know  O
bagels  O
and  O
pretzels  O

   
that's  O
been  O
looked  O
at  O
and  O
what  O
they've  O
really  O
determined  O
is  O
that  O
consumers  O
you  O
know  O
we  O
really  O
can't  O
figure  O
out  O
which  O
one  O
is  O
worse  O

   
is  O
it  O
the  O
lollipop  O
it's  O
it's  O
just  O
it's  O
it's  O
a  O
little  O
too  O
confusing  O
but  O
joe  B-MISC
pesci  I-MISC
put  O
it  O
better  O

   
all  O
right  O
the  O
acorn  O
got  O
to  O
get  O
to  O
the  O
acorn  O

   
there  O
were  O
people  O
fifteen  O
thousand  O
years  O
ago  O
that  O
were  O
in  O
morocco  B-MISC
northern  O
morocco  B-MISC
and  O
they  O
were  O
eating  O
acorns  O

   
and  O
that's  O
the  O
teeth  O
they  O
got  O
from  O
it  O

   
they  O
weren't  O
using  O
sugar  O

   
they  O
figured  O
out  O
a  O
way  O
with  O
stone  O
tools  O
i  B-MISC
guess  O
to  O
refine  O
the  O
carbohydrates  O
from  O
acorns  O
into  O
acellular  O
dense  O
acellular  O
carbohydrates  O
and  O
that's  O
the  O
result  O

   
not  O
too  O
good  O

   
so  O
the  O
paleo  O
diet  O
you  O
know  O
paleo  O
cookies  O
no  O
no  O

   
okay  O
real  O
quick  O
i  B-MISC
got  O
to  O
go  O
through  O
this  O
my  O
time  O
is  O
up  O

   
this  O
is  O
the  O
real  O
formula  O
dense  O
acellular  O
carbohydrate  O
any  O
oral  O
microbiome  O
we  O
all  O
have  O
one  O
you  O
can  O
not  O
have  O
one  O
that's  O
all  O
you  O
need  O
you  O
need  O
teeth  O
anybody  O
here  O
no  O
teeth  O
you're  O
in  O
the  O
wrong  O
r-  O
lecture  O
room  O

   
the  O
food  O
has  O
to  O
be  O
retained  O
on  O
the  O
teeth  O
for  O
a  O
time  O
because  O
brushing  O
and  O
flossing  O
works  O
that's  O
why  O
we  O
recommend  O
it  O

   
the  O
frequency  O
we  O
went  O
over  O
that  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
don't  O
have  O
time  O
to  O
get  O
into  O
it  O
but  O
the  O
quality  O
of  O
your  O
saliva  O
and  O
your  O
salivary  O
flow  O
is  O
very  O
very  O
important  O

   
this  O
is  O
my  O
future  O
bestseller  O
we  O
got  O
wheat  O
belly  O
and  O
grain  O
brain  O
why  O
not  O
carb  O
mouth  O
that's  O
really  O
what  O
it  O
is  O
if  O
i  B-MISC
had  O
to  O
simplify  O
it  O
i  B-MISC
my  O
time  O
is  O
brief  O
you  O
can  O
i'll  B-MISC
be  O
happy  O
to  O
send  O
these  O
slides  O
to  O
you  O
that's  O
my  O
email  O

that's  O
my  O

and  O
a  O
wannabe  O
anthropologist  O
not  O
not  O
quite  O
yet  O
there  O
but  O
in  O
training  O

   
this  O
is  O
the  O
second  O
time  O
we've  O
done  O
this  O
last  O
last  O
year  O
was  O
sort  O
of  O
a  O
hiatus  O
and  O
this  O
year  O
we're  O
resuming  O
it  O
we  O
don't  O
have  O
one  O
of  O
our  O
founding  O
members  O
alvin  B-MISC

   
however  O
he  O
will  O
be  O
saying  O
a  O
few  O
words  O
to  O
you  O
in  O
a  O
minute  O
but  O
this  O
is  O
some  O
his  O
contributions  O
to  O
dentistry  O
and  O
to  O
the  O
paleo  O
healthcare  O
movement  O

   
it's  O
al  I-MISC
danenberg  I-MISC
i  I-MISC
wish  O
i  B-MISC
were  O
there  O
in  O
person  O
i'm  B-MISC
here  O
in  O
video  O
i'm  B-MISC
here  O
in  O
spirit  O
but  O
unfortunately  O
not  O
in  O
person  O

   
i  O
have  O
some  O
medical  O
issues  O
that  O
#are  O
preventing  O
me  O
from#  O
traveling  O

   
but  O
i  B-MISC
wanted  O
to  O
say  O
a  O
couple  O
things  O

   
2  O
years  O
ago  O
the  O
2  O
docs  O
and  O
myself  O
were  O
part  O
of  O
the  O
first  O
dental  O
panel  O
that  O
was  O
presented  O
at  O
the  O
ancestral  B-MISC
health  I-MISC
symposium  I-MISC
and  O
it  O
was  O
awesome  O

   
the  O
audience  O
loved  O
it  O
we  O
had  O
great  O
questions  O
and  O
i'm  B-MISC
sure  O
this  O
one  O
is  O
going  O
to  O
be  O
even  O
better  O

   
the  O
most  O
important  O
thing  O
today  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
is  O
that  O
there's  O
so  O
much  O
research  O
that's  O
going  O
on  O
with  O
the  O
gut  O
microbiome  O
the  O
oral  O
health  O
and  O
overall  O
chronic  O
disease  O
and  O
it's  O
so  O
intricately  O
and  O
intimately  O
related  O

   
dentistry  O
it's  O
just  O
the  O
perfect  O
profession  O
to  O
speak  O
of  O
these  O
matters  O
because  O
who's  O
the  O
physician  O
of  O
the  O
mouth  O
dentists  O
are  O

   
so  O
if  O
we  O
can  O
get  O
the  O
word  O
out  O
and  O
p-  O
and  O
people  O
understand  O
how  O
important  O
the  O
gut  O
is  O
to  O
the  O
mouth  O
which  O
is  O
so  O
critical  O
to  O
the  O
rest  O
of  O
the  O
body  O
we  O
are  O
in  O
great  O
shape  O
and  O
we're  O
making  O
a  O
real  O
dent  O
in  O
the  O
medical  O
profession  O

   
have  O
a  O
great  O
seminar  O
i  B-MISC
know  O
you  O
guys  O
are  O
gonna  O
do  O
a  O
wonderful  O
job  O

   
let  O
me  O
know  O
how  O
things  O
go  O
i  B-MISC
am  O
excited  O
for  O
you  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
wish  O
i  B-MISC
were  O
there  O
but  O
have  O
a  O
great  O
one  O
let  O
me  O
know  O
take  O
care  O

   
that's  O
great  O
so  O
you  O
know  O
everybody  O
here  O
is  O
so  O
inspired  O

   
send  O
him  O
you  O
know  O
a  O
note  O
saying  O
how  O
you're  O
glad  O
to  O
hear  O
from  O
him  O
and  O
we're  O
gonna  O
try  O
to  O
beam  O
him  O
in  O
next  O
year  O
and  O
just  O
encourage  O
him  O

   
you  O
might  O
you  O
might  O
actually  O
help  O
increase  O
the  O
quality  O
and  O
quantity  O
of  O
his  O
life  O

   
this  O
group  O
means  O
so  O
much  O
to  O
him  O
so  O
glad  O
we  O
could  O
do  O
that  O
it  O
was  O
nice  O
that  O
it  O
turned  O
out  O
great  O

   
you  O
just  O
gave  O
me  O
that  O
well  O
okay  O
that  O
isn't  O
working  O
so  O
let's  O
try  O
that  O

   
last  O
year  O
i  B-MISC
did  O
a  O
similar  O
thing  O
2  O
years  O
ago  O
and  O
and  O
scott  B-MISC
and  O
alvin  B-MISC
that  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
talked  O
about  O
the  O
shrinking  O
face  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
wasn't  O
quite  O
as  O
much  O
as  O
far  O
i  B-MISC
am  O
in  O
my  O
research  O
as  O
i  B-MISC
am  O
now  O
is  O
that  O
what  O
affects  O
the  O
face  O
affects  O
the  O
airway  O

   
and  O
i'm  B-MISC
gonna  O
develop  O
that  O
concept  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O

   
shortly  O
after  O
that  O
montana  B-MISC
meeting  O
last  O
year  O
i  B-MISC
went  O
to  O
salt  B-MISC
lake  I-MISC
city  I-MISC
and  O
spoke  O
at  O
the  O
international  B-MISC
society  I-MISC
of  O
evolution  B-MISC
medicine  I-MISC
and  O
public  B-MISC
health  I-MISC
and  O
developed  O
this  O
whole  O
concept  O
from  O
them  O
after  O
this  O
meeting  O
2  O
years  O
ago  O
so  O
i  B-MISC
this  O
this  O
group  O
means  O
a  O
lot  O
to  O
me  O
every  O
time  O
i  B-MISC
come  O
here  O
just  O
through  O
networking  O
and  O
and  O
speaking  O
and  O
the  O
questions  O
that  O
it  O
really  O
helps  O
me  O
advance  O
my  O
own  O
curiosity  O
and  O
things  O
that  O
i  B-MISC
can  O
contribute  O
to  O
the  O
science  O
at  O
least  O
in  O
this  O
lecture  O
circuit  O

   
this  O
is  O
something  O
that  O
i  B-MISC
took  O
out  O
in  O
the  O
lobby  O
in  O
bozeman  B-MISC
montana  I-MISC

   
and  O
that  O
guess  O
what  O
is  O
a  O
habitual  O
nose  O
breather  O
probably  O
from  O
birth  O
and  O
probably  O
while  O
mom  O
was  O
carrying  O
this  O
woman  O
and  O
man  O
when  O
they  O
were  O
babies  O

   
they  O
also  O
the  O
mothers  O
probably  O
were  O
nose  O
breathers  O
because  O
we  O
found  O
out  O
that  O
just  O
like  O
the  O
flight  O
attendant  O
says  O
put  O
the  O
mask  O
on  O
yourself  O
before  O
you  O
help  O
your  O
kid  O

   
the  O
placenta  O
is  O
very  O
selective  O
for  O
oxygen  O
mom  O
gets  O
priority  O
it's  O
the  O
only  O
nutrient  O
that  O
mothers  O
get  O
priority  O
for  O

   
'cause  O
if  O
a  O
mom  O
dies  O
the  O
baby  O
dies  O
so  O
babies  O
throughout  O
our  O
whole  O
300000  O
years  O
of  O
anatomically  O
modern  O
human  O
history  O
have  O
learned  O
in  O
utero  O
to  O
to  O
not  O
only  O
survive  O
with  O
low  O
or  O
to  O
relative  O
to  O
you  O
know  O
what  O
we  O
get  O
when  O
we're  O
in  O
the  O
outside  O
world  O

   
but  O
the  O
the  O
po2  B-MISC
in  O
utero  O
is  O
actually  O
thinner  O
than  O
the  O
air  O
on  O
top  O
of  O
mount  B-MISC
everest  I-MISC
and  O
actually  O
a  O
mile  O
above  O
mount  B-MISC
everest  I-MISC
and  O
that  O
that's  O
a  O
study  O
that  O
was  O
done  O
in  O
the  O
18  O
hundreds  O
by  O
sir  B-MISC
barcroft  I-MISC
in  O
england  B-MISC

   
why  O
is  O
this  O
important  O
why  O
am  O
i  B-MISC
so  O
intrigued  O
about  O
this  O
michael  B-MISC
mew  I-MISC
is  O
marianna  B-MISC
evans  I-MISC
is  O
and  O
there's  O
several  O
people  O
that  O
are  O
really  O
pursuing  O
this  O
because  O
it  O
not  O
only  O
makes  O
a  O
difference  O
in  O
how  O
we  O
look  O

   
but  O
it  O
makes  O
a  O
difference  O
in  O
how  O
the  O
brain  O
grows  O
and  O
what  O
we  O
commonly  O
call  O
attention  B-MISC
deficit  I-MISC
disorder  I-MISC
often  O
is  O
these  O
kids  O
early  O
on  O
before  O
maybe  O
they're  O
diagnosed  O
they  O
have  O
co-morbid  O
malocclusion  O
that  O
can  O
preclude  O
them  O
breathing  O
habitually  O
through  O
their  O
nose  O

   
so  O
that's  O
kind  O
of  O
the  O
basis  O
of  O
the  O
thesis  O
that  O
i'm  B-MISC
working  O
on  O

   
i'm  O
a  O
visiting  O
scholar  O
at  O
penn  B-MISC
and  O
i'm  B-MISC
also  O
now  O
an  O
assistant  O
professor  O
of  O
anthropology  O
at  O
the  O
university  B-MISC
of  O
arkansas  B-MISC
under  O
jerry  B-MISC
rose  I-MISC
mentoring  O
a  O
phd  B-MISC
student  O
who  O
wants  O
to  O
she's  O
been  O
time  O
at  O
my  O
office  O
looking  O
at  O
my  O
data  O
on  O
how  O
i  B-MISC
clinically  O
apply  O
anthropological  O
theories  O
to  O
clinical  O
practice  O

   
and  O
also  O
that's  O
what  O
we  O
are  O
doing  O
at  O
the  O
university  B-MISC
of  O
pennsylvania  B-MISC
so  O
as  O
last  O
year  O
we  O
we  O
were  O
2  O
years  O
ago  O
we  O
had  O
steven  B-MISC
#*  O
who  O
helped  O
us  O
moderate  O
and  O
brett  B-MISC
is  O
helping  O
and  O
we've  O
got  O
all  O
kind  O
of  O
help  O
today  O
that  O
i  B-MISC
didn't  O
wasn't  O
aware  O
of  O
so  O
thank  O
you  O
all  O
for  O
for  O
all  O
the  O
support  O

   
next  O
month  O
in  O
boston  B-MISC
i'll  I-MISC
be  O
speaking  O
at  O
the  O
oral  B-MISC
medicine  I-MISC
tactic-  I-MISC
toxicology  I-MISC
group  O
which  O
is  O
you  O
know  O
i  B-MISC
can't  O
even  O
pronounce  O
it  O
i'm  B-MISC
substituting  O
for  O
michael  B-MISC
gelb  I-MISC
'cause  O
he  O
couldn't  O
come  O
and  O
this  O
is  O
where  O
i  B-MISC
was  O
looking  O
at  O
scott's  B-MISC
vitae  I-MISC
and  O
you  O
know  O
he's  O
really  O
involved  O
with  O
functional  O
medicine  O
so  O
this  O
is  O
an  O
area  O
where  O
i'd  B-MISC
have  O
been  O
developing  O
this  O
lecture  O
for  O
them  O

   
and  O
i  B-MISC
adapted  O
it  O
for  O
today's  O
talk  O
so  O
instead  O
of  O
assessing  O
pre-apnea  O
in  O
the  O
pediatric  O
dental  O
patient  O
you  O
know  O
and  O
then  O
what  O
do  O
with  O
it  O
clinically  O
i'm  B-MISC
just  O
gonna  O
talk  O
about  O
pediatric  O
sleep  O
apnea  O
sort  O
of  O
as  O
a  O
western  B-MISC
disease  O
a  O
non-communicable  O
disease  O
that  O
is  O
coe-  O
seems  O
to  O
coexist  O
with  O
cultural  O
industrialization  O

   
this  O
is  O
what  O
i'm  B-MISC
gonna  O
tell  O
you  O
for  O
20  O
minutes  O

   
that  O
jaws  O
and  O
faces  O
are  O
intimately  O
connected  O
to  O
the  O
airway  O
and  O
that  O
orthotropics  O
orthodontics  O
dentofacial  O
orthopedics  O
it's  O
the  O
ortho  O
that  O
latin  B-MISC
or  O
greek  B-MISC
for  O
correct  O

   
john  O
who  O
is  O
one  O
who  O
really  O
turned  O
me  O
onto  O
this  O
about  O
20  O
years  O
ago  O
or  O
15  O
years  O
ago  O

   
and  O
actually  O
got  O
me  O
access  O
to  O
the  O
roman  B-MISC
skulls  O
at  O
the  O
british  B-MISC
museum  O
that  O
he  O
had  O
access  O
to  O
and  O
he  O
developed  O
and  O
mike  B-MISC
you  O
can  O
fill  O
in  O
the  O
blanks  O
on  O
that  O
of  O
when  O
he  O
actually  O
developed  O
this  O
in  O
the  O
fifties  O
and  O
sixties  O
but  O
i  B-MISC
was  O
there  O
really  O
to  O
look  O
at  O
the  O
same  O
roman  B-MISC
skulls  O

   
and  O
have  O
since  O
looked  O
at  O
thousands  O
of  O
other  O
skulls  O
and  O
and  O
pretty  O
much  O
provided  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
support  O
for  O
his  O
orthotropic  O
hypothesis  O

   
one  O
of  O
the  O
things  O
i  B-MISC
found  O
is  O
that  O
it  O
works  O
in  O
kids  O
while  O
they  O
still  O
have  O
their  O
baby  O
teeth  O
2  O
to  O
six  O
year-olds  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
found  O
literature  O
from  O
medical  O
and  O
dental  O
literature  O
from  O
over  O
a  O
100  O
years  O
ago  O
that  O
seemed  O
to  O
validate  O
this  O
protocol  O
that  O
that  O
we  O
use  O
in  O
chicago  B-MISC
and  O
elsewhere  O

   
observational  O
studies  O
again  O
as  O
opposed  O
to  O
random  O
controlled  O
trials  O
don't  O
pooh-pooh  O
at  O
observational  O
studies  O
oh  O
show  O
me  O
the  O
random  O
controlled  O
trials  O
bullshit  O

   
you  O
know  O
you  O
need  O
observational  O
studies  O
before  O
you  O
can  O
run  O
random  O
controlled  O
trials  O

   
how  O
do  O
you  O
think  O
they  O
discovered  O
you  O
should  O
wash  O
your  O
hands  O
before  O
you  O
deliver  O
babies  O

   
how  O
do  O
you  O
think  O
einstein  B-MISC
you  O
know  O
came  O
up  O
the  O
theory  O
of  O
relativity  O

   
these  O
were  O
all  O
observations  O
the  O
broad  B-MISC
street  I-MISC
pump  O
and  O
cholera  O
in  O
england  B-MISC
it  O
was  O
observations  O
that  O
led  O
to  O
major  O
breakthroughs  O
penicillin  O
observational  O
studies  O
what  O
drove  O
these  O
major  O
breakthroughs  O
in  O
medicine  O
and  O
and  O
humanity  O

   
here's  O
a  O
paper  O
from  O
1912  O
the  O
relief  O
of  O
nasal  O
obstruction  O
by  O
orthodontia  O
a  O
plea  O
for  O
early  O
recognition  O
and  O
correction  O
of  O
faulty  O
maxillary  O
development  O

   
do  O
you  O
know  O
many  O
papers  O
i  B-MISC
have  O
like  O
this  O
that  O
go  O
back  O
to  O
the  O
late  O
19  O
century  O

   
all  O
the  O
way  O
up  O
through  O
about  O
world  B-MISC
war  I-MISC
two  I-MISC
something  O
happened  O
in  O
world  B-MISC
war  I-MISC
two  I-MISC

   
and  O
anthropologists  O
have  O
come  O
up  O
with  O
really  O
good  O
speculations  O
as  O
to  O
what  O
happened  O
which  O
we  O
can  O
go  O
into  O
in  O
q  B-MISC
&amp;  O
a  O
if  O
you  O
want  O

   
the  O
back  O
of  O
the  O
face  O
is  O
the  O
airway  O
the  O
front  O
of  O
the  O
airway  O
is  O
the  O
face  O

   
okay  O
jaws  O
and  O
faces  O
are  O
intimately  O
connected  O
the  O
craniofacial  O
complex  O
the  O
respiratory  O
system  O
okay  O

   
and  O
that's  O
what  O
we  O
now  O
call  O
the  O
craniofacial  O
respiratory  O
complex  O
michael  B-MISC
mew  I-MISC
was  O
the  O
first  O
to  O
publish  O
on  O
craniofacial  O
dystrophy  O

   
i  O
have  O
suggested  O
that  O
if  O
there's  O
craniofacial  O
dystrophy  O
there's  O
often  O
co-morbid  O
respiratory  O
dystrophy  O

   
so  O
i  B-MISC
would  O
like  O
you  O
know  O
and  O
this  O
we've  O
got  O
this  O
in  O
3  O
textbooks  O
now  O
that  O
have  O
recently  O
put  O
chapters  O
on  O
what's  O
called  O
the  O
craniofacial  O
respiratory  O
complex  O

   
this  O
is  O
from  O
1922  O
30  O
months  O
of  O
age  O
being  O
considered  O
the  O
most  O
favorable  O
time  O
to  O
begin  O
expansion  O
of  O
children  O

   
i  O
mean  O
you  O
are  O
you  O
are  O
considered  O
a  O
heretic  O
if  O
you  O
want  O
to  O
treat  O
kids  O
before  O
the  O
age  O
of  O
seven  O
which  O
is  O
the  O
american  B-MISC
association  I-MISC
of  O
orthodontists  B-MISC
says  O
that  O
is  O
the  O
age  O
when  O
children  O
should  O
shist-  O
sh-  O
first  O
be  O
observed  O
observed  O
for  O
their  O
first  O
orthodontic  O
evaluation  O

   
but  O
usually  O
not  O
treated  O
till  O
between  O
11  O
and  O
13  O

   
that's  O
what's  O
common  O
in  O
the  O
western  B-MISC
world  O
right  O
now  O
england  B-MISC
and  O
in  O
america  B-MISC
especially  O

   
i  O
am  O
really  O
trying  O
to  O
persuade  O
and  O
be  O
diplomatic  O

   
i've  O
now  O
got  O
the  O
editor-in-chief  O
of  O
the  O
american  B-MISC
journal  I-MISC
of  O
orthodontics  B-MISC
and  O
dentofacial  B-MISC
orthopedics  I-MISC
engaged  O
on  O
a  O
in  O
a  O
dialogue  O
and  O
that  O
is  O
not  O
a  O
not  O
a  O
debate  O
it's  O
a  O
dialogue  O

   
and  O
he  O
is  O
responding  O
to  O
what  O
i'm  B-MISC
saying  O
that  O
that  O
age  O
should  O
be  O
way  O
before  O
7  O

   
7  O
years  O
old  O
is  O
a  O
geriatric  O
patient  O
in  O
my  O
pediatric  O
practice  O

   
i've  O
got  O
kids  O
coming  O
from  O
all  O
over  O
the  O
country  O
just  O
like  O
mike's  B-MISC
got  O
people  O
coming  O
to  O
him  O
from  O
all  O
over  O
the  O
world  O
that  O
are  O
seeking  O
this  O
treatment  O
because  O
conventional  O
thought  O
just  O
do  O
not  O
do  O
that  O
yet  O

   
this  O
is  O
a  O
2  O
year-old  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
john  B-MISC
mew's  I-MISC
design  O
of  O
a  O
stage  O
one  O
bio-block  O
appliance  O

   
i  O
use  O
this  O
on  O
kids  O
you  O
know  O
if  O
they  O
got  O
20  O
teeth  O
i'm  B-MISC
gonna  O
start  O
expanding  O
them  O

   
both  O
parents  O
have  O
to  O
be  O
on  O
board  O
if  O
one  O
parent  O
is  O
negative  O
i'm  B-MISC
not  O
gonna  O
treat  O
i  B-MISC
refuse  O

   
both  O
parents  O
have  O
to  O
understand  O
and  O
at  O
least  O
be  O
neutral  O
to  O
positive  O
that  O
this  O
is  O
in  O
the  O
best  O
long  O
term  O
health  O
interest  O
of  O
their  O
kids  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
validated  O
by  O
a  O
100  O
years  O
of  O
observational  O
studies  O

   
normal  O
does  O
not  O
mean  O
healthy  O

   
normal  O
blood  O
pressure  O
1  O
20  O
over  O
80  O
right  O

   
for  O
whom  O
a  O
given  O
population  O
average  O
amongst  O
americans  B-MISC
by  O
the  O
american  B-MISC
heart  I-MISC
association  I-MISC

   
how  O
about  O
these  O
guys  O

   
look  O
at  O
the  O
differences  O
there  O

   
that's  O
probably  O
genomic  O
that  O
we  O
all  O
descend  O
from  O
this  O
group  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
khoisan  B-MISC
in  O
in  O
africa  B-MISC
we  O
we  O
shared  O
99  O
point  O
9  O
percent  O
if  O
not  O
more  O
of  O
their  O
genome  O

   
everybody  O
who  O
got  O
out  O
of  O
africa  B-MISC
about  O
70000  O
years  O
ago  O
descended  O
from  O
this  O
tribe  O

   
spencer  O
wells  I-MISC
and  O
the  O
genografic  B-MISC
project  I-MISC
watch  O
that  O
video  O
it's  O
incredible  O
and  O
he  O
talks  O
about  O
this  O

   
what  O
does  O
normal  O
mean  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
occlusion  O

   
these  O
are  O
from  O
orthodontic  O
journals  O
guess  O
what  O
this  O
studied  O
to  O
determine  O
what  O
was  O
normal  O

   
anthropological  O
specimens  O
a  O
predated  O
industry  O

   
okay  O
this  O
used  O
to  O
be  O
part  O
of  O
dental  O
education  O

   
the  O
university  B-MISC
of  O
virginia's  B-MISC
medical  O
school  O
in  O
the  O
twenties  O
required  O
third  O
year  O
third  O
year  O
medical  O
students  O
to  O
take  O
a  O
course  O
in  O
orthodontics  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
commonly  O
understood  O
connection  O
between  O
respiratory  O
health  O
and  O
occlusion  O

   
so  O
all  O
of  O
these  O
erupted  O
third  O
molars  O
ahead  O
of  O
you  O
know  O
the  O
condyles  O
here  O

   
i  O
don't  O
know  O
if  O
this  O
works  O

   
well  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
ramus  O
and  O
the  O
wisdom  O
teeth  O
are  O
always  O
ahead  O
of  O
it  O
in  O
lateral  O
view  O

   
you  O
don't  O
even  O
get  O
wisdom  O
teeth  O
anymore  O

   
so  O
i'm  B-MISC
just  O
gonna  O
plaster  O
these  O
but  O
the  O
the  O
orthodontic  O
medical  O
literature  O
is  O
loaded  O
with  O
specimens  O
that  O
inform  O
clinicians  O
during  O
their  O
training  O
that  O
come  O
from  O
pre-industrialized  O
museum  O
specimen  O

   
when  O
this  O
when  O
this  O
problem  O
start  O

   
ontogeny  O
the  O
development  O
of  O
the  O
individual  O
from  O
conception  O
to  O
death  O

   
phylogeny  O
the  O
that  O
is  O
the  O
development  O
of  O
our  O
species  O

   
when  O
did  O
malocclusion  O
first  O
enter  O
our  O
species  O
and  O
one  O
when  O
does  O
it  O
usually  O
enter  O
in  O
from  O
an  O
ontological  O
perspective  O
perhaps  O
in  O
utero  O

   
these  O
are  O
fetal  O
skulls  O
from  O
4  O
5  O
100  O
years  O
ago  O
in  O
of  O
stillborn  O
fetuses  O
that  O
didn't  O
make  O
it  O
or  O
or  O
infants  O

   
they  O
all  O
look  O
like  O
john  B-MISC
mew  I-MISC
#*  O
orthotropic  O
#sounding  O

   
they  O
all  O
and  O
if  O
you  O
look  O
at  O
an  O
ultrasound  O
of  O
any  O
of  O
you  O
who  O
have  O
children  O
if  O
you  O
look  O
at  O
your  O
mid-gestational  O
ultrasounds  O

   
you'll  O
very  O
felt-  O
seldom  O
find  O
a  O
chin  O
that  O
sits  O
right  O
underneath  O
the  O
maxilla  O

   
so  O
that's  O
you  O
know  O
from  O
an  O
ontogeny  O
perspective  O

   
and  O
this  O
is  O
actually  O
a  O
kid  O
i'm  B-MISC
treating  O

   
the  O
mother  O
brought  O
and  O
she  O
was  O
i  B-MISC
was  O
treating  O
for  O
her  O
one  O
of  O
her  O
kids  O
and  O
she  O
shows  O
me  O
an  O
ultrasound  O
and  O
said  O
it  O
looks  O
like  O
i  B-MISC
am  O
making  O
you  O
another  O
patient  O
and  O
it's  O
like  O
i  B-MISC
wonder  O
if  O
there's  O
a  O
connection  O

   
all  O
that  O
was  O
7  O
years  O
ago  O
and  O
we've  O
since  O
accumulated  O
maybe  O
200  O
mid-gestational  O
ultrasounds  O
of  O
kids  O
that  O
i'm  B-MISC
treating  O
for  O
retrognathia  O

   
and  O
there  O
does  O
seem  O
to  O
be  O
a  O
connection  O
but  O
it's  O
seen  O
that's  O
observational  O
it's  O
not  O
scientific  O
yet  O
so  O
i'm  B-MISC
not  O
making  O
any  O
proclamations  O
on  O
any  O
#*  O
hundred  O

   
these  O
are  O
things  O
that  O
we  O
so  O
we  O
understood  O
the  O
nature  O
of  O
respiration  O
and  O
failure  O
to  O
thrive  O
or  O
or  O
intrauterine  O
growth  O
restriction  O

   
look  O
at  O
this  O
and  O
that  O
what  O
this  O
says  O
is  O
people  O
are  O
always  O
telling  O
me  O
that  O
smoking  O
causes  O
low  O
birth  O
weight  O

   
talk  O
about  O
a  O
win  O
win  O
win  O

   
you  O
know  O
easy  O
labor  O
slim  O
baby  O
full  O
flavor  O
of  O
winston  B-MISC

   
so  O
it  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
oh  O
my  O
god  B-MISC
you  O
should  O
hear  O
the  O
interviews  O
with  O
these  O
and  O
these  O
who  O
work  O
for  O
the  O
tobacco  O
lobby  O

   
and  O
it's  O
like  O
some  O
women  O
wanna  O
have  O
small  O
babies  O

   
so  O
anyway  O
phylogeny  O
is  O
when  O
it  O
enters  O

   
now  O
i  B-MISC
imagine  O
several  O
hands  O
will  O
go  O
up  O
knowing  O
the  O
right  O
answer  O
to  O
this  O
but  O
when  O
i  B-MISC
give  O
this  O
to  O
physicians  O
and  O
dentists  O
i  B-MISC
very  O
seldom  O
get  O
one  O
hand  O
coming  O
up  O
and  O
it's  O
usually  O
not  O
right  O

   
so  O
this  O
is  O
something  O
that  O
needs  O
to  O
be  O
incorporated  O
into  O
grade  O
school  O
how  O
about  O
it  O

   
so  O
it  O
looks  O
like  O
i  B-MISC
got  O
minutes  O

   
that  O
so  O
i'm  B-MISC
really  O
move  O
through  O
this  O

   
the  O
the  O
jaws  O
and  O
faces  O
got  O
narrower  O
they  O
got  O
retrusive  O
and  O
they  O
got  O
longer  O

   
the  O
last  O
major  O
milestone  O
in  O
the  O
7  O
million  O
years  O
of  O
hominid  O
evolution  O
is  O
the  O
emergence  O
of  O
modern  O
humans  O
or  O
homo  O
sapiens  O

   
people  O
who  O
for  O
the  O
first  O
time  O
fundamentally  O
looked  O
and  O
behaved  O
like  O
us  O

   
while  O
a  O
date  O
of  O
around  O
200000  O
years  O
ago  O
was  O
frequently  O
given  O
for  O
this  O
dynamic  O
there  O
are  O
still  O
substantial  O
debate  O
regarding  O
the  O
timing  O
as  O
something  O
that  O
was  O
an  O
ongoing  O
process  O
rather  O
than  O
a  O
single  O
point  O
in  O
geological  O
time  O

   
anatomically  O
it  O
is  O
widely  O
recognized  O
that  O
facial  O
size  O
reduction  O
or  O
gracilization  O
or  O
feminization  O
as  O
it  O
is  O
sometimes  O
called  O

   
as  O
well  O
as  O
facial  O
retraction  O
are  O
key  O
to  O
finding  O
traits  O
for  O
our  O
species  O

   
so  O
anyway  O
i  B-MISC
found  O
literature  O
a  O
cause  O
for  O
lessened  O
prognathism  O
from  O
the  O
orthodontic  O
literature  O
from  O
1881  O

   
okay  O
so  O
this  O
was  O
understood  O
as  O
long  O
ago  O
as  O
that  O
that  O
our  O
faces  O
but  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
the  O
retraction  O
was  O
just  O
something  O
that  O
was  O
academically  O
interesting  O
the  O
people  O
they  O
didn't  O
understand  O
the  O
connection  O
or  O
at  O
least  O
on  O
a  O
broad  O
scale  O
of  O
its  O
relationship  O
to  O
malocclusion  O
and  O
airway  O

   
so  O
you  O
know  O
i'm  B-MISC
saying  O
that  O
is  O
you  O
know  O
breastfeeding  O
has  O
a  O
lot  O
to  O
do  O
with  O
an  O
ancestral  O
patterns  O
of  O
nursing  O
and  O
weaning  O

   
but  O
also  O
papoosing  O
look  O
at  O
that  O
kid  O
in  O
the  O
papoose  O
the  O
posture  O
of  O
that  O
head  O
and  O
neck  O

   
so  O
it  O
wasn't  O
just  O
the  O
nursing  O
and  O
weaning  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
also  O
things  O
like  O
that  O

   
and  O
also  O
the  O
the  O
type  O
of  O
pressure  O
that  O
is  O
exerted  O
by  O
click  O
talking  O
which  O
is  O
what  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
african  B-MISC
and  O
the  O
people  O
that  O
were  O
related  O
to  O
do  O
that's  O
kind  O
all  O
kinds  O
of  O
pressure  O
early  O
in  O
life  O

   
this  O
is  O
one  O
of  O
our  O
ancestral  O
museum  O
skulls  O
and  O
you  O
can  O
look  O
at  O
the  O
difference  O
of  O
that  O
position  O

   
signs  O
of  O
mouth  O
breathing  O
the  O
chin  O
recedes  O
mothers  O
will  O
accuse  O
children  O
of  O
inattention  O
they  O
didn't  O
call  O
it  O
add  B-MISC
but  O
this  O
is  O
from  O
i  B-MISC
don't  O
know  O
yeah  O
1908  O
look  O
at  O
this  O

   
so  O
i'm  B-MISC
gonna  O
buzz  O
these  O
are  O
just  O
some  O
cases  O

   
you  O
could  O
see  O
that  O
you  O
know  O
that  O
the  O
airway  O
is  O
retrusive  O
it's  O
black  O
and  O
narrow  O
like  O
that  O
that  O
means  O
that  O
kid  O
has  O
a  O
very  O
narrow  O
and  O
poorly  O
shaped  O
airway  O
when  O
you  O
bring  O
the  O
chin  O
forward  O
you  O
open  O
up  O
the  O
airway  O

   
we  O
don't  O
just  O
look  O
at  O
physical  O
signs  O
but  O
behavioral  O

   
on  O
the  O
top  O
those  O
are  O
all  O
those  O
yeses  O
are  O
behaviors  O
that  O
track  O
with  O
risk  O
for  O
sleep  O
apnea  O
and  O
sleep  O
apnea  O
is  O
a  O
pre-  O
predisposition  O
to  O
add  B-MISC

   
and  O
they  O
all  O
come  O
back  O
no  O
so  O
now  O
orthodontic  O
criteria  O
success  O
criteria  O
is  O
not  O
just  O
physical  O
changes  O
but  O
behavioral  O
changes  O

   
i'm  O
just  O
you  O
know  O
how  O
much  O
time  O
do  O
i  B-MISC
have  O

   
not  O
much  O

   
okay  O
three  O
minutes  O

   
we've  O
also  O
discovered  O
an  O
algorithm  O
from  O
about  O
30  O
years  O
of  O
research  O
at  O
harvard  B-MISC
and  O
elsewhere  O
where  O
if  O
you  O
know  O
a  O
child  O
should  O
have  O
space  O
for  O
a  O
nickel  O
between  O
each  O
baby  O
tooth  O

   
that  O
means  O
there's  O
room  O
for  O
the  O
tongue  O

   
so  O
when  O
we  O
see  O
no  O
space  O
between  O
baby  O
teeth  O
we  O
know  O
there  O
is  O
no  O
room  O
for  O
the  O
tongue  O

   
for  O
no  O
other  O
reason  O
not  O
to  O
straighten  O
them  O
they  O
don't  O
they  O
don't  O
even  O
have  O
to  O
be  O
crooked  O
but  O
we  O
expand  O
these  O
kids  O
and  O
we  O
give  O
them  O
tongue  O
space  O

   
that  O
is  O
really  O
the  O
killer  O
argument  O
for  O
this  O

   
and  O
when  O
you  O
show  O
parents  O
and  O
what  O
happens  O
when  O
you  O
make  O
room  O
for  O
the  O
tongue  O
and  O
what  O
what  O
happens  O
to  O
the  O
airway  O
is  O
very  O
it  O
does  O
no  O
harm  O

   
it  O
does  O
no  O
harm  O

   
it  O
can  O
help  O
them  O
solve  O
it  O
if  O
they  O
need  O
more  O
ortho  O
down  O
the  O
road  O
it's  O
just  O
like  O
a  O
kid  O
who  O
has  O
nearsightedness  O

   
are  O
you  O
gonna  O
tell  O
a  O
parent  O
a  O
3  O
year-old  O
whose  O
kid  O
is  O
nearsighted  O
you  O
know  O
what  O
they'd  O
be  O
a  O
good  O
candidate  O
for  O
glasses  O
someday  O
why  O
don't  O
we  O
give  O
them  O
when  O
they're  O
like  O
driving  O
a  O
car  O
then  O
you  O
have  O
to  O
pay  O
for  O
them  O
once  O
that's  O
how  O
ridiculous  O
medically  O
indefensible  O
it  O
is  O
to  O
say  O
that  O
you  O
should  O
delay  O
orthodontics  O
because  O
a  O
kid  O
only  O
as  O
baby  O
teeth  O

   
if  O
anybody  O
has  O
children  O
or  O
first  O
order  O
second  O
order  O
relatives  O
grand  O
kids  O
kids  O
you  O
may  O
be  O
the  O
first  O
person  O
to  O
recognize  O

   
ask  O
the  O
parent  O

   
watch  O
and  O
see  O
if  O
the  O
kid  O
is  O
snoring  O

   
and  O
you  O
might  O
be  O
the  O
person  O
to  O
to  O
really  O
help  O
that  O
kid  O
avoid  O
the  O
problem  O

   
okay  O
so  O
i'm  B-MISC
done  O
i  B-MISC
got  O
more  O
but  O
got  O
to  O
end  O
here  O
so  O
we  O
can  O
do  O
some  O
questions  O

   
@applause  O

   
@garbage-until-the-end  O

   
about  O
mismatch  O
and  O
male  O
but  O

   
there  O
are  O
other  O
reasons  O

   
for  O
why  O
evolution  O
as  O
powerful  O
cannot  O
sculpt  O
perfect  O

   
arms  O
race  O
race  O
with  O
pathogens  O
especially  O
scott  B-MISC
presentation  O
seemed  O
affected  O
for  O
the  O
mismatch  O
effect  O
of  O
dense  O
acellular  O
carbohydrates  O
is  O
as  O
tilted  O
the  O
playing  O
field  O
toward  O
more  O
virulent  O
pathogenic  O
bacterial  O
species  O
in  O

   
the  O
mouth  O
so  O
how  O
it  O
mismatched  O
intersects  O
with  O
another  O
major  O
category  O

   
was  O
rushed  O
for  O
time  O
before  O
dimension  O
other  O
thing  O
germs  O
for  O
gum  O
disease  O
have  O
never  O
changed  O
always  O
had  O
we  O
never  O
had  O
gum  O
disease  O
so  O

   
is  O
it  O
the  O
germs  O
or  O
is  O
the  O
environment  O
that  O

   
i  O

   
terms  O
dense  O
acellular  O
carbohydrates  O
just  O
one  O
there  O
are  O
lots  O
of  O
a  O

   
ted  O
geisel  I-MISC
we  O
really  O

   
salivary  O
is  O
very  O
important  O
and  O
not  O
sleeping  O
properly  O
exhausted  O
you're  O
stressed  O
so  O
even  O
if  O
a  O
nutrientdense  O
diet  O
you  O

   
so  O
other  O
words  O
of  O
the  O
quality  O
of  O
your  O
saliva  O

   
but  O
it's  O
not  O
flowing  O
you  O
know  O
you  O
can  O
heal  O
demineralization  O
also  O
mouth  O
breathing  O
during  O
poor  O
sleep  O
mouth  O
breathing  O
is  O
dries  O
the  O
mouth  O

   
or  O
intraarticular  O
answers  O
short  O
so  O
we  O
can  O
get  O
more  O
questions  O
that  O
that's  O
a  O
great  O
question  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
combination  O
same  O
thing  O
with  O
cavity  O

   
caries  O
organisms  O
they've  O
been  O
with  O
us  O
forever  O
even  O
use  O
them  O
to  O
track  O
migrations  O
out  O
of  O
africa  B-MISC
strep  O
mutants  O
is  O
the  O
primary  O
cariogenic  O
bacteria  O

   
paige  O
caulfield  I-MISC
at  O
alabama  B-MISC
actually  O
bred  O
alabama  B-MISC

   
trap  O
he  O
uses  O
that  O
to  O
track  O
migrations  O
because  O
those  O
bacteria  O
have  O
been  O
with  O
us  O
they've  O
just  O
never  O
been  O
pathogenic  O
mean  O
lack  O
these  O
deficiency  O
isn't  O
pathogenic  O
you  O
drink  O
milk  O
so  O
it's  O
the  O
environment  O
that  O
change  O

   
into  O

   
this  O

   
press  O

   
there  O
some  O
magic  O
or  O
some  O
key  O
nutrient  O

   
to  O

   
that  O
one  O
thing  O

   
western  O
price  O
did  O
darwin  B-MISC
and  O
i  B-MISC
would  O
say  O

   
that  O
were  O
some  O
parts  O

   
so  O
dark  O
darwin  B-MISC
got  O
things  O
wrong  O
price  O
einstein  B-MISC

   
k  O
thing  O
far  O
stretched  O
the  O
chewing  O

   
you  O
passed  O

   
absolutely  O
so  O
not  O
diminish  O

   
steps  O
right  O
direction  O

   
that  O
can't  O
build  O
a  O
perfect  O

   
the  O
nutrients  O
you  O
deserve  O
so  O
yes  O
the  O
nutrients  O
are  O
we  O
just  O
put  O
the  O
spotlight  O
some  O
we  O
try  O
to  O
connect  O
the  O
dots  O
and  O
we're  O
pretty  O

   
with  O
vitamin  O
i  B-MISC

   
western  O
price  O

   
related  O
constituents  O

   
data  O
so  O
with  O

   
groups  O
one  O
study  O
was  O
produced  O
was  O

   
show  O
you  O

   
make  O
vitamin  O
k  B-MISC
deficient  O
and  O
they  O
had  O
stunted  O
growth  O
growth  O
stunted  O
maxilla  O

   
but  O
it  O
was  O
stunted  O
now  O

   
with  O
confusing  O
pathology  O
with  O

   
vitamin  O
deficiency  O
is  O
a  O
pathological  O

   
i  O
would  O
say  O
that  O
the  O
facial  O
forms  O
of  O
everyone  O
in  O
the  O
audience  O
not  O
grown  O
correctly  O
based  O
on  O
ancestral  O

   
so  O

   
you  O
have  O

   
very  O
rare  O
significant  O

   
so  O
yet  O
really  O
to  O
find  O
good  O
evidence  O
against  O
to  O
support  O

   
a  O
question  O

   
other  O

   
avoid  O

   
oral  O
rinses  O
thanks  O

   
no  O
nose  O
breathing  O
is  O
key  O
as  O
young  O
as  O
early  O
in  O
life  O
as  O
pass  O
that's  O
my  O
contribution  O
like  O
we  O
have  O
three  O
dentists  O
appear  O

   
thing  O
i  B-MISC
want  O
to  O
attack  O
but  O
that  O
the  O
only  O

   
you  O
think  O
scott  B-MISC
well  O
it  O
starts  O
with  O
maternal  O
and  O
paternal  O
nutrition  O
years  O

   
scott  O
start  O

   
once  O
the  O
child  O

   
you  O
can  O
see  O
sometimes  O
there  O

   
retro  O

   
jaws  O
back  O
so  O
afterwards  O
it's  O
critical  O

   
what  O
is  O
going  O
with  O
facial  O
for  O
they  O
have  O
teeth  O

   
yes  O

   
paleo  O
diet  O

   
not  O
actually  O
in  O
the  O
basis  O
of  O
recommending  O
any  O
specific  O
but  O
stay  O

   
our  O
nutrients  O
into  O
your  O
body  O
you  O
should  O
be  O
processed  O
relating  O

   
probiotics  O

   
to  O
me  O
it's  O
like  O
if  O
you're  O
running  O

   
a  O
nicer  O
zoo  O
tigers  O
bears  O

   
but  O
are  O
rabbit  O
pellets  O

   
bare  O
feed  O

   
and  O
if  O
you  O
have  O
a  O
zoo  O
that's  O
full  O
of  O
deer  O
have  O
so  O
yes  O
you  O
can  O
introduce  O
bacteria  O
probiotics  O
that's  O
all  O
well  O
but  O
the  O
environment  O
that  O

   
is  O
really  O
what  O
brings  O
fish  O
finding  B-MISC
dentist  O
i  B-MISC
have  O
a  O
fish  O
tank  O
office  O

   
algae  O
or  O
whatever  O
in  O
there  O
but  O
it  O
got  O
in  O
there  O
and  O
it's  O
growing  O
because  O
it's  O
a  O
good  O
environment  O
for  O
the  O
bottle  O
get  O

   
so  O
that  O
is  O
and  O
don't  O
smoke  O

   
tobacco  O
or  O

   
oral  O
microbiome  O
excessive  O
brush  O
mentioned  O
out  O
and  O

   
carry  O

   
already  O
disrupted  O
or  O
altered  O
xylitol  O
getting  O
of  O
attention  O
and  O
the  O
pediatric  O
dentistry  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
never  O
been  O
pro  B-MISC
any  O
one  O
nutrient  O
really  O
down  O
on  O
sugar  O
but  O
there  O
some  O
impressive  O
information  O

   
sila  O
tall  O
so  O
stay  O
tuned  O
i  B-MISC
agree  O

   
gum  O
gum  O
recession  O

   
gum  O
recession  O
like  O
mike's  B-MISC
mike's  I-MISC
opinion  O
because  O
he's  O
north  B-MISC
adonis  I-MISC
and  O
commonly  O
that  O
is  O
a  O
problem  O
so  O
well  O
holding  O
lots  O
teeth  O
out  O

   
with  O
retainers  O
now  O
you  O
might  O
on  O
the  O
teeth  O

   
cheeks  O

   
side  O
that  O

   
if  O
you  O
need  O
wear  O
retainer  O
you're  O
holding  O
teeth  O
out  O
of  O

   
whole  O
gum  O
tissue  O

   
i  O
won't  O
mention  O
it's  O
probably  O
word  O
few  O
of  O
you  O
have  O
heard  O
it's  O
called  O
an  O
abbe  B-MISC
fraction  O
so  O
some  O
of  O
you  O
may  O
notice  O
up  O

   
touch  O
it's  O
very  O
sore  O
notch  O
there  O
that's  O
generally  O
from  O
the  O
teeth  O
colliding  O
together  O
if  O
they're  O
not  O
aligned  O
or  O
grinder  O

   
real  O
heavy  O
gum  O
chewer  O
forces  O
connection  O

   
by  O
the  O
gum  O
line  O
recession  O
still  O
yet  O
another  O
reason  O
to  O
get  O
your  O
children's  O
jaws  O
their  O
tongue  O
early  O
in  O
life  O

   
prevents  O
adult  O
problems  O
start  O
so  O
don't  O
if  O
your  O
instincts  O
says  O
my  O
kid  O
needs  O
their  O
jaw  O
expanded  O
the  O
orthodontist  O
as  O

   
well  O
this  O
or  O

   
gum  O
disease  O
orthodontics  O
subsequent  O

   
so  O
we  O
have  O
to  O
current  O

   
fake  O
