@applause  O

   
good  O
afternoon  O

   
it's  O
a  O
pleasure  O
to  O
be  O
here  O

   
i  O
wanna  O
thank  O
the  O
co-directors  O
of  O
the  O
course  O
and  O
the  O
dental  B-MISC
school  O
for  O
the  O
invitation  O
to  O
come  O
and  O
speak  O
to  O
you  O
about  O
a  O
topic  O
that  O
i  B-MISC
actually  O
feel  O
quite  O
passionate  O
about  O

   
and  O
i  B-MISC
wanna  O
also  O
thank  O
doctor  O
polverini  B-MISC
for  O
the  O
wonderful  O
dinner  O
last  O
night  O
and  O
the  O
discussions  O

   
what  O
i  B-MISC
would  O
like  O
to  O
do  O
is  O
by  O
way  O
of  O
overview  O
just  O
talk  O
to  O
you  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O
about  O
genetics  O
and  O
how  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
genetics  O
has  O
influenced  O
my  O
research  O
and  O
also  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
is  O
influencing  O
the  O
field  O
specifically  O
the  O
translation  O
of  O
clinical  O
research  O
in  O
the  O
clinical  O
practice  O

   
to  O
do  O
that  O
i'm  B-MISC
gonna  O
overview  O
a  O
little  O
perspective  O
genetics  O

   
i'm  O
gonna  O
talk  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O
about  O
enamel  O
and  O
dent-  O
defects  O
and  O
really  O
from  O
the  O
clinical  O
perspective  O
as  O
i  B-MISC
see  O
it  O
now  O
and  O
going  O
forward  O

   
jim  O
simmer  I-MISC
is  O
gonna  O
talk  O
more  O
about  O
mechanistic  O
biology  O
of  O
these  O
defects  O

   
then  O
i  B-MISC
wanna  O
talk  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O
about  O
have  O
a  O
think  O
session  O
about  O
clinical  O
implications  O
and  O
i'm  B-MISC
talking  O
about  O
the  O
future  O
of  O
how  O
we're  O
gonna  O
integrate  O
genetics  O
in  O
the  O
clinical  O
care  O

   
and  O
to  O
do  O
that  O
i'm  B-MISC
gonna  O
review  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O
of  O
the  O
different  O
types  O
of  O
genetic  O
diseases  O
just  O
very  O
broadly  O
and  O
how  O
genetic  O
factors  O
contribute  O
to  O
disease  O
'cause  O
i  O
think  O
that  O
understanding  O
is  O
really  O
important  O
to  O
understand  O
or  O
or  O
trying  O
to  O
see  O
where  O
the  O
future  O
is  O
going  O

   
now  O
with  O
that  O
said  O
nowadays  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
it's  O
not  O
a  O
rush  O
statement  O
to  O
say  O
the  O
etiologic  O
basis  O
of  O
most  O
human  O
diseases  O
can  O
be  O
defined  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
or  O
due  O
to  O
gene-gene  O
and  O
or  O
gene-environment  O
interactions  O

   
and  O
in  O
fact  O
this  O
whole  O
concept  O
which  O
was  O
really  O
a  O
little  O
more  O
radical  O
at  O
the  O
time  O
in  O
the  O
late  O
80s  O
early  O
90s  O
when  O
the  O
human  B-MISC
genome  I-MISC
project  I-MISC
was  O
conceived  O
but  O
this  O
idea  O
that  O
genetics  O
underlies  O
diseases  O
was  O
were  O
fundamental  O
driving  O
force  O
of  O
the  O
human  B-MISC
genome  I-MISC
project  I-MISC

   
and  O
the  O
idea  O
was  O
that  O
if  O
genetics  O
were  O
important  O
you  O
need  O
to  O
identify  O
the  O
genes  O
responsible  O
clone  O
them  O
out  O
to  O
figure  O
out  O
how  O
they  O
function  O
to  O
develop  O
better  O
diagnostic  O
and  O
treatment  O
based  O
etiologies  O

   
and  O
at  O
the  O
time  O
i  B-MISC
remind  O
you  O
genetics  O
was  O
done  O
in  O
small  O
labs  O
like  O
cottage  O
industries  O
around  O
the  O
world  O
very  O
slow  O
very  O
expensive  O
not  O
real  O
productive  O

   
at  O
the  O
time  O
our  O
thoughts  O
of  O
genetics  O
was  O
really  O
somewhat  O
gene-centric  O
in  O
that  O
we  O
were  O
looking  O
or  O
the  O
field  O
was  O
focused  O
more  O
most  O
people  O
were  O
focused  O
on  O
mutations  O
or  O
genetic  O
variants  O
of  O
coding  O
genes  O
and  O
proteins  O

   
now  O
the  O
human  B-MISC
genome  I-MISC
project  I-MISC
was  O
actually  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
the  O
culmination  O
in  O
some  O
ways  O
of  O
a  O
number  O
of  O
important  O
discoveries  O
in  O
genetics  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
realize  O
in  O
the  O
back  O
you  O
may  O
not  O
be  O
able  O
to  O
see  O
this  O
but  O
earlier  O
fundamentals  O
and  O
rediscovery  O
of  O
mendel's  B-MISC
law  I-MISC
the  O
elucidation  O
of  O
the  O
structure  O
of  O
dna  B-MISC
which  O
was  O
actually  O
a  O
collaborative  O
effort  O
identifying  O
had  O
a  O
sequence  O
of  O
genes  O
and  O
how  O
to  O
identify  O
had  O
a  O
sequence  O
of  O
dna  B-MISC
and  O
how  O
to  O
identify  O
genetic  O
markers  O
really  O
was  O
necessary  O
preamble  O
to  O
the  O
human  B-MISC
genome  I-MISC
project  I-MISC

   
but  O
the  O
project  O
itself  O
#*  O
state  O
was  O
the  O
first  O
big  O
science  O
initiative  O

   
and  O
again  O
as  O
i  B-MISC
said  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
we  O
need  O
to  O
remember  O
that  O
impetus  O
for  O
the  O
human  B-MISC
genome  I-MISC
project  I-MISC
was  O
really  O
a  O
clinical  O
driving  O
force  O
but  O
it  O
really  O
led  O
to  O
the  O
industrialization  O
of  O
science  O

   
and  O
by  O
that  O
i  B-MISC
mean  O
development  O
of  O
new  O
information  O
systems  O
new  O
technologies  O
which  O
continues  O
to  O
advance  O
at  O
a  O
tremendous  O
rate  O
even  O
today  O
when  O
the  O
human  B-MISC
genome  I-MISC
project  I-MISC
was  O
begone  O
the  O
technologies  O
to  O
complete  O
the  O
project  O
didn't  O
exist  O
but  O
they  O
were  O
successfully  O
developed  O

   
and  O
an  O
important  O
factor  O
was  O
that  O
outside  O
the  O
war  O
time  O
efforts  O
you  O
really  O
didn't  O
have  O
global  O
industries  O
with  O
large  O
r  B-MISC
and  O
d  B-MISC
budgets  O
academics  O
and  O
different  O
institutions  O
different  O
countries  O
governments  O
and  O
private  O
industry  O
all  O
participating  O
towards  O
the  O
common  O
goal  O

   
so  O
this  O
is  O
in  O
many  O
ways  O
the  O
first  O
big  O
science  O
particularly  O
the  O
first  O
science  O
biology  O
project  O

   
and  O
as  O
a  O
result  O
your  O
taxpay-  O
your  O
tax  O
dollars  O
are  O
actually  O
contributing  O
to  O
a  O
number  O
of  O
big  O
science  O
projects  O
and  O
some  O
of  O
them  O
are  O
listed  O
here  O
there's  O
a  O
website  O
you  O
can  O
find  O
more  O
information  O
about  O
these  O

   
but  O
some  O
of  O
these  O
are  O
really  O
changing  O
the  O
way  O
not  O
only  O
that  O
we  O
perform  O
research  O
but  O
our  O
understanding  O
of  O
science  O
and  O
biology  O
and  O
i'm  B-MISC
gonna  O
mention  O
a  O
little  O
later  O
the  O
results  O
last  O
month  O
of  O
three  O
projects  O
deep  O
sequencing  O
projects  O
genome-wide  O
association  O
studies  O
and  O
the  O
encode  B-MISC
project  I-MISC
which  O
have  O
actually  O
fundamentally  O
changed  O
in  O
my  O
opinion  O
our  O
concept  O
of  O
genetics  O
of  O
complex  O
diseases  O

   
and  O
as  O
a  O
geneticist  O
i'd  B-MISC
say  O
the  O
september  B-MISC
results  O
of  O
the  O
encode  B-MISC
data  O
is  O
the  O
most  O
fundamental  O
change  O
in  O
genetics  O
since  O
i've  B-MISC
been  O
in  O
the  O
field  O
in  O
25  O
years  O

   
as  O
a  O
result  O
of  O
these  O
big  O
science  O
projects  O
the  O
way  O
we  O
study  O
human  O
diseases  O
is  O
changing  O
dramatically  O

   
we  O
in  O
addition  O
to  O
studying  O
human  O
cells  O
we  O
study  O
different  O
animal  O
organisms  O
mice  O
zebra  O
fish  O
the  O
fruit  O
fly  O

   
and  O
we  O
have  O
high  O
throughput  O
technologies  O
producing  O
data  O

   
so  O
with  O
this  O
the  O
emphasis  O
is  O
on  O
translation  O
you  O
know  O
how  O
what  O
have  O
you  O
done  O
from  O
the  O
#*  O
clinically  O
type  O
thing  O

   
but  O
also  O
we  O
need  O
to  O
consider  O
how  O
genetic  O
factors  O
contribute  O
to  O
the  O
diagnosis  O
and  O
treatment  O
of  O
diseases  O
and  O
i'm  B-MISC
gonna  O
end  O
up  O
talking  O
more  O
about  O
that  O

   
so  O
what's  O
what's  O
the  O
value  O
of  O
understanding  O
the  O
genetic  O
basis  O
of  O
the  O
disease  O
and  O
while  O
some  O
of  O
this  O
is  O
in  O
#*  O
obvious  O
other  O
other  O
aspects  O
of  O
this  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
we  O
need  O
to  O
consider  O
a  O
bit  O

   
t-  O
understanding  O
the  O
genetics  O
of  O
the  O
disease  O
gene  O
contributions  O
really  O
helps  O
us  O
understand  O
etiology  O

   
okay  O
but  O
then  O
what  O
can  O
that  O
help  O
us  O
do  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
this  O
is  O
important  O
understanding  O
the  O
etiology  O
of  O
disease  O
helps  O
as  O
determine  O
the  O
classification  O
or  O
the  O
nosology  O
of  O
diseases  O

   
and  O
you'll  O
see  O
that  O
today  O
when  O
we  O
talk  O
about  O
amelogenesis  O
imperfecta  O
clinically  O
we  O
talk  O
about  O
ai  B-MISC
but  O
etiologically  O
that's  O
due  O
to  O
many  O
different  O
it's  O
many  O
different  O
etiologic  O
forms  O
different  O
gene  O
mutations  O
cause  O
that  O

   
and  O
that's  O
important  O
because  O
with  O
that  O
identified  O
you  O
can  O
then  O
diagnose  O
people  O
with  O
specific  O
forms  O
of  O
the  O
disease  O

   
and  O
importantly  O
if  O
you  O
can  O
then  O
group  O
those  O
people  O
together  O
and  O
instead  O
of  O
a  O
one-size-all  O
treatment  O
you  O
can  O
start  O
to  O
to  O
develop  O
treatments  O
that  O
are  O
based  O
on  O
a  O
specific  O
etiology  O
of  O
that  O
condition  O

   
and  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
that's  O
really  O
critical  O

   
and  O
what  O
we're  O
talking  O
about  O
here  O
is  O
really  O
personalized  O
healthcare  O

   
ultimate  O
goal  O
is  O
to  O
develop  O
a  O
proactive  O
a  O
preventative  O
healthcare  O
system  O

   
but  O
the  O
ability  O
to  O
do  O
that  O
we're  O
still  O
away  O
away  O
from  O

   
and  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
personalized  O
healthcare  O
i  B-MISC
mentioned  O
those  O
big  O
science  O
projects  O
they're  O
really  O
there're  O
findings  O
of  O
last  O
month  O
they  O
really  O
changed  O
how  O
we're  O
gonna  O
go  O
about  O
this  O
i  B-MISC
believe  O

   
now  O
you  O
may  O
or  O
may  O
not  O
be  O
aware  O
that  O
there  O
is  O
over  O
8000  O
inherited  O
human  O
disorders  O

   
in  O
fact  O
more  O
than  O
35  O
100  O
mendelian  O
disorders  O
meaning  O
a  O
single  O
gene  O
can  O
cause  O
them  O

   
30  O
to  O
40  O
percent  O
of  O
them  O
involve  O
some  O
oral  O
dental  O
or  O
craniofacial  O
phenotype  O

   
and  O
in  O
fact  O
for  O
genetic  O
defects  O
and  O
syndromes  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
the  O
most  O
common  O
manifestation  O
may  O
be  O
midface  O
hypoplasia  O

   
but  O
some  O
of  O
these  O
diseases  O
affect  O
just  O
the  O
teeth  O
as  O
in  O
ai  B-MISC
just  O
enamel  O
defects  O
or  O
just  O
the  O
dentin  O
others  O
affects  O
just  O
the  O
gingiva  O
and  O
then  O
others  O
have  O
more  O
pleomorphic  O
effects  O
affecting  O
multiple  O
tissues  O

   
and  O
in  O
some  O
cases  O
these  O
are  O
all  O
totally  O
unrelated  O
individuals  O
in  O
some  O
cases  O
they  O
drive  O
development  O
in  O
a  O
profound  O
way  O

   
now  O
this  O
was  O
an  O
important  O
aspect  O
in  O
my  O
early  O
work  O
when  O
i  B-MISC
was  O
a  O
phd  B-MISC
student  O
there  O
were  O
just  O
the  O
technologies  O
to  O
develop  O
that  O
you  O
can  O
match  O
genes  O
from  O
mendelian  O
defects  O
with  O
you  O
know  O
with  O
dna  B-MISC
from  O
family  O
categories  O

   
and  O
it  O
was  O
theoretically  O
possible  O
it  O
was  O
just  O
beginning  O
to  O
to  O
be  O
practically  O
performed  O

   
now  O
i'm  B-MISC
gonna  O
talk  O
about  O
two  O
conditions  O
amelogenesis  O
imperfecta  O
and  O
dentinogenesis  O
imperfecta  O
and  O
i'm  B-MISC
gonna  O
speak  O
about  O
those  O
and  O
put  O
them  O
in  O
perspective  O
of  O
how  O
genetics  O
helps  O
us  O
understand  O
etiology  O
diagnosis  O
and  O
treatment  O
so  O
that's  O
a  O
theme  O
i  B-MISC
wanna  O
develop  O
as  O
i  B-MISC
go  O
through  O
the  O
the  O
talk  O
this  O
this  O
afternoon  O

   
ai  O
as  O
you  O
are  O
aware  O
affects  O
development  O
of  O
the  O
enamel  O
so  O
it's  O
an  O
abnormal  O
development  O
of  O
the  O
enamel  O
the  O
underlined  O
dentin  O
is  O
normal  O
but  O
radiographically  O
what's  O
showing  O
here  O
is  O
that  O
the  O
enamel  O
layer  O
radiopaque  O
and  O
then  O
it's  O
not  O
shown  O
in  O
these  O
teeth  O
which  O
were  O
affected  O
by  O
ai  B-MISC

   
now  O
clinically  O
ai  B-MISC
has  O
been  O
described  O
for  O
many  O
many  O
many  O
years  O
and  O
clinically  O
there's  O
4  O
general  O
types  O
and  O
14  O
subtypes  O
that  O
consider  O
a  O
number  O
of  O
variables  O
including  O
pattern  O
of  O
inheritance  O

   
and  O
i  B-MISC
i've  I-MISC
always  O
found  O
these  O
are  O
very  O
confusing  O

   
and  O
while  O
you  O
can  O
find  O
certain  O
individuals  O
and  O
it's  O
easy  O
to  O
classify  O
into  O
one  O
of  O
these  O
4  O
subtypes  O
clinically  O
it's  O
really  O
it  O
becomes  O
problematic  O
in  O
many  O
many  O
cases  O

   
people  O
just  O
don't  O
fit  O
into  O
any  O
of  O
these  O

   
this  O
is  O
a  O
problem  O
for  O
you  O
know  O
clinical  O
diagnostics  O
and  O
it's  O
not  O
unique  O
to  O
dentistry  O

   
germatology  O
the  O
field  O
of  O
germatology  O
went  O
through  O
has  O
gone  O
through  O
a  O
similar  O
type  O
of  O
thing  O

   
the  O
problem  O
is  O
that  O
clinical  O
diseases  O
were  O
identified  O
and  O
described  O
long  O
before  O
we  O
had  O
the  O
ability  O
to  O
identify  O
the  O
etiologic  O
underpinnings  O

   
so  O
they're  O
imprecise  O
and  O
what's  O
developing  O
now  O
is  O
using  O
incorporating  O
them  O
into  O
genetics  O
to  O
develop  O
better  O
nosologies  O

   
now  O
the  O
prevalence  O
of  O
ai  B-MISC
varies  O
in  O
different  O
parts  O
of  O
the  O
world  O
dramatically  O

   
and  O
as  O
i  B-MISC
mentioned  O
it  O
can  O
be  O
inherited  O
in  O
a  O
number  O
of  O
different  O
manners  O

   
it's  O
x-linked  O
autosomal  O
dominant  O
or  O
autosomal  O
recessive  O
mendelian  O
patterns  O
of  O
inheritance  O

   
now  O
when  O
you  O
have  O
a  O
disease  O
that's  O
genetic  O
you  O
think  O
there's  O
a  O
genetic  O
basis  O
based  O
on  O
f-  O
on  O
any  O
of  O
your  O
findings  O
for  O
instance  O

   
this  O
is  O
an  O
ideogram  O
showing  O
chromosomes  O

   
so  O
the  O
challenge  O
is  O
if  O
you  O
have  O
a  O
family  O
segregating  O
the  O
disease  O
initially  O
which  O
gene  O
is  O
responsible  O
where  O
is  O
the  O
gene  O
located  O
before  O
we  O
had  O
maps  O
of  O
the  O
genome  O
or  O
the  O
ability  O
to  O
sequence  O
as  O
we  O
do  O
nowadays  O

   
so  O
what  O
was  O
performed  O
is  O
sometimes  O
called  O
reverse  O
genetics  O
and  O
basically  O
the  O
methodology  O
involves  O
gathering  O
families  O
phenotyping  O
who  O
is  O
and  O
who  O
is  O
not  O
affected  O

   
and  O
that's  O
critical  O
and  O
sometimes  O
overlooked  O
the  O
importance  O
of  O
that  O
care  O
for  O
phenotyping  O

   
and  O
that's  O
where  O
the  O
role  O
of  O
good  O
clinicians  O
is  O
really  O
critical  O

   
but  O
phenotyping  O
who  O
is  O
not  O
affected  O
extracting  O
dna  B-MISC
and  O
then  O
genotyping  O
them  O

   
no  O
matter  O
what  O
the  O
genetic  O
markers  O
you  O
know  O
we've  O
talked  O
about  O
genetic  O
fingerprinting  O
and  O
you're  O
seeing  O
all  O
the  O
forensic  O
shows  O
but  O
all  O
genetic  O
fingerprinting  O
was  O
all  O
developed  O
for  O
gene  O
mapping  O

   
the  O
forensics  O
usually  O
follows  O
the  O
development  O
of  O
genotyping  O
techniques  O
that  O
have  O
been  O
employed  O
for  O
mapping  O
genes  O

   
so  O
what's  O
done  O
is  O
y-  O
sequence  O
of  O
genotyped  O
individuals  O
for  O
different  O
genetic  O
polymorphisms  O
and  O
then  O
try  O
and  O
determine  O
which  O
polymorphism  O
segregates  O
through  O
families  O
with  O
a  O
particular  O
genotype  O

   
and  O
there  O
is  O
mathematical  O
algorithms  O
that  O
you  O
can  O
apply  O
or  O
are  O
applied  O

   
and  O
with  O
that  O
you  O
can  O
use  O
that  O
information  O
to  O
localize  O
the  O
causative  O
gene  O
for  O
a  O
disorder  O
to  O
a  O
chromosomal  O
location  O

   
you  O
don't  O
need  O
to  O
know  O
anything  O
about  O
the  O
gene  O
involved  O
this  O
technique  O
just  O
allows  O
you  O
to  O
localize  O
the  O
gene  O

   
and  O
nowadays  O
you  O
can  O
just  O
look  O
in  O
and  O
see  O
what  O
genes  O
are  O
in  O
that  O
genetic  O
interval  O

   
you  O
know  O
that's  O
on  O
databases  O

   
we  O
focused  O
on  O
databases  O
because  O
we  O
used  O
to  O
have  O
to  O
determine  O
what  O
genes  O
were  O
in  O
the  O
interval  O

   
and  O
then  O
you  O
sequence  O
theoretically  O
sequence  O
through  O
the  O
candidate  O
genes  O
until  O
you  O
identify  O
the  O
genetic  O
alteration  O
that  O
seems  O
like  O
it  O
would  O
be  O
responsible  O
for  O
the  O
gene  O
defect  O

   
okay  O
so  O
that's  O
the  O
general  O
approach  O

   
and  O
this  O
approach  O
is  O
been  O
used  O
to  O
identify  O
the  O
genes  O
for  O
many  O
of  O
the  O
35  O
100  O
mendelian  O
conditions  O
that  O
are  O
reported  O
today  O

   
for  O
ai  B-MISC
these  O
are  O
just  O
some  O
of  O
them  O
there's  O
a  O
few  O
more  O
recessive  O
forms  O
that  O
have  O
been  O
identified  O
more  O
recently  O

   
but  O
what  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
here  O
is  O
for  O
instance  O
for  O
autosomal  O
recessive  O
ai  B-MISC
mutations  O
of  O
multiple  O
different  O
genes  O
can  O
cause  O
that  O
disease  O

   
clinically  O
they  O
may  O
have  O
looked  O
the  O
same  O
or  O
overlapping  O
okay  O

   
but  O
the  O
gene  O
for  O
these  O
are  O
very  O
different  O
the  O
enam  B-MISC
gene  O
is  O
on  O
chromosome  O
4  O
mmp20  O
is  O
on  O
chromosome  O
11  O

   
they're  O
totally  O
different  O
genes  O

   
what  O
that's  O
helping  O
is  O
first  O
of  O
all  O
is  O
to  O
start  O
to  O
establish  O
the  O
nosology  O

   
as  O
i  B-MISC
mentioned  O
before  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
parallel  O
of  O
germatologic  O
conditions  O
that  O
look  O
very  O
similar  O
part  O
of  O
the  O
difficulty  O
that  O
was  O
how  O
to  O
describe  O
the  O
d-  O
correct  O
diagnosis  O

   
as  O
the  O
genetic  O
etiology  O
of  O
germatologic  O
conditions  O
wor-  O
was  O
established  O
and  O
this  O
was  O
really  O
over  O
the  O
last  O
20  O
years  O
and  O
then  O
treatments  O
were  O
developed  O
based  O
on  O
specific  O
etiologies  O
the  O
diagnosis  O
and  O
treatment  O
of  O
the  O
field  O
advanced  O
dramatically  O

   
and  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
that's  O
what  O
we're  O
experiencing  O
or  O
will  O
be  O
experiencing  O
in  O
dentistry  O

   
a  O
lot  O
of  O
work  O
to  O
be  O
done  O
but  O
that's  O
the  O
direction  O
we're  O
going  O
at  O

   
now  O
jim  B-MISC
simmer  I-MISC
is  O
gonna  O
talk  O
about  O
some  O
of  O
these  O
specific  O
mutations  O
and  O
their  O
effects  O

   
i'm  O
gonna  O
talk  O
just  O
an  O
overview  O
about  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
genotype-phenotype  O
correlations  O
and  O
what  O
i  B-MISC
mean  O
by  O
that  O
is  O
when  O
you  O
identif-  O
well  O
how  O
that  O
how  O
clinicians  O
can  O
have  O
a  O
role  O
and  O
the  O
importance  O
of  O
developing  O
this  O
genotype-phenotype  O
correlations  O

   
this  O
slide  O
dates  O
me  O

   
this  O
is  O
important  O
from  O
when  O
i  B-MISC
was  O
a  O
dental  O
student  O
i  B-MISC
just  O
want  O
to  O
illustrate  O
when  O
i  B-MISC
was  O
a  O
dental  O
student  O
without  O
these  O
names  O
of  O
these  O
protei-  O
proteinases  O
here  O
this  O
is  O
how  O
i  B-MISC
was  O
taught  O
tooth  O
development  O

   
you  O
know  O
there  O
is  O
not  O
too  O
much  O
specific  O
going  O
on  O
here  O

   
you  O
know  O
that  O
was  O
really  O
you  O
know  O
getting  O
tested  O
on  O
that  O
and  O
i'm  B-MISC
trying  O
to  O
think  O
how  O
did  O
they  O
wrote  O
exam  O
questions  O

   
but  O
wanting  O
to  O
understand  O
the  O
genetic  O
etiology  O
we  O
can  O
then  O
identify  O
what  O
the  O
players  O
are  O
and  O
understand  O
the  O
pathways  O
that  O
are  O
in  O
normal  O
growth  O
and  O
development  O
and  O
in  O
abnormal  O
growth  O
and  O
development  O

   
very  O
critical  O

   
now  O
for  O
enamel  O
and  O
mutations  O
there  O
are  O
mutations  O
depending  O
on  O
the  O
type  O
of  O
mutation  O
can  O
cause  O
either  O
autosomal  O
recessive  O
ai  B-MISC
or  O
autosomal  O
dominant  O
ai  B-MISC
so  O
just  O
knowing  O
the  O
gene  O
doesn't  O
tell  O
you  O
actually  O
how  O
the  O
disease  O
is  O
gonna  O
manifest  O

   
now  O
enamelin  O
is  O
the  O
most  O
abundant  O
protein  O
in  O
the  O
enamel  O
matrix  O
of  O
developing  O
teeth  O
and  O
i'm  B-MISC
going  O
to  O
illustrate  O
here  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
case  O
from  O
families  O
in  O
turkey  B-MISC
with  O
independent  O
families  O

   
we  O
did  O
the  O
linkage  O
analysis  O
localized  O
the  O
gene  O
to  O
chromosome  O
4  O
did  O
mutation  O
analysis  O
and  O
identified  O
the  O
same  O
gene  O
mutation  O
in  O
probands  O
affected  O
individuals  O
from  O
different  O
not  O
believed  O
to  O
be  O
related  O
families  O

   
@void  O

   
since  O
2-base  O
pair  O
insertion  O
you  O
know  O
the  O
triplet  O
codon  O
for  O
dna  B-MISC
coding  O
would  O
cause  O
a  O
frameshift  O
and  O
change  O
the  O
result  O
and  O
protein  O
sometimes  O
creating  O
a  O
a  O
a  O
a  O
premature  O
stop  O
codon  O
and  O
that's  O
what  O
happens  O
here  O
so  O
that  O
you  O
have  O
a  O
truncated  O
protein  O
that's  O
not  O
functional  O

   
and  O
what  O
we  O
found  O
in  O
examining  O
individuals  O
and  O
their  O
families  O
you  O
found  O
individuals  O
who  O
had  O
no  O
copy  O
of  O
the  O
mutation  O
individuals  O
who  O
carried  O
1  O
copy  O
of  O
the  O
mutation  O
for  O
instance  O
the  O
parents  O
were  O
each  O
carriers  O
and  O
then  O
affected  O
individuals  O
had  O
2  O
copies  O
of  O
the  O
mutation  O

   
and  O
these  O
are  O
the  O
3  O
3  O
of  O
the  O
probands  O
from  O
unrelated  O
families  O
from  O
distant  O
well  O
we  O
thought  O
unrelated  O
from  O
different  O
parts  O
of  O
turkey  B-MISC

   
so  O
they  O
looked  O
in  O
the  O
sense  O
they  O
had  O
an  O
skeletal  O
open  O
bite  O
amelogenesis  O
imperfecta  O
okay  O
2  O
copies  O
of  O
the  O
enamelin  O
mutation  O

   
when  O
we  O
did  O
other  O
studies  O
of  O
surrounding  O
dna  B-MISC
it  O
turned  O
out  O
that  O
these  O
individuals  O
were  O
all  O
related  O
distantly  O
related  O

   
so  O
they  O
had-  O
back  O
in  O
their  O
ancestry  O
all  O
inherited  O
a  O
common  O
mutation  O
from  O
a  O
common  O
ancestor  O
which  O
is  O
a  O
founder  O
effect  O

   
but  O
what  O
we  O
also  O
noted  O
that  O
with  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
individuals  O
but  O
they  O
had  O
enamel  O
pitting  O
and  O
we're  O
interested  O
in  O
enamel  O
pitting  O
because  O
in  O
the  O
anthropology  O
literature  O
enamel  O
pitting  O
and-  O
of  O
teeth  O
is  O
relat-  O
is  O
in  O
many  O
cases  O
taken  O
as  O
environmental  O
challenge  O
insult  O
fever  O
illness  O
or  O
dietary  O
restriction  O

   
and  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
actually  O
what  O
we're  O
seeing  O
here  O
is  O
there's  O
a  O
genetic  O
basis  O
for  O
this  O
independent  O
of  O
those  O
other  O
factors  O
that  O
for  O
some  O
people  O
that  O
would  O
be  O
normal  O
development  O

   
so  O
we  O
had  O
this  O
enamel  O
pitting  O
sort  O
of  O
striking  O
enamel  O
pitting  O

   
and  O
we  O
look  O
back  O
at  O
our  O
families  O
what  O
we  O
see  O
here  O
these  O
are  O
a  O
family  O
pedigree  O
this  O
is  O
showing  O
2  O
carrier  O
individuals  O
parents  O
this  O
is  O
an  O
affected  O
individual  O
that  O
has  O
2  O
copies  O
of  O
that  O
enam  B-MISC
mutation  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
sibling  O
with  O
1  O
copy  O
of  O
the  O
enam  B-MISC
mutation  O
these  O
other  O
individuals  O
who  O
have  O
no  O
copies  O
this  O
bars  O
just  O
represent  O
individuals  O
who  O
we  O
phenotype  O
and  O
did  O
a  O
dna  B-MISC
analysis  O
on  O

   
and  O
what  O
we  O
found  O
here  O
with  O
the  O
individuals  O
with  O
2  O
copies  O
of  O
the  O
enam  B-MISC
mutation  O
had  O
the  O
full  O
phenotype  O
if  O
you  O
like  O

   
skeletal  O
open  O
bite  O
amelogenesis  O
imperfecta  O
but  O
the  O
individuals  O
who  O
all  O
carried  O
1  O
copy  O
of  O
the  O
mutation  O
all  O
had  O
this  O
enamel  O
pitting  O

   
so  O
with  O
this  O
information  O
we've  O
starting  O
to  O
develop  O
a  O
more  O
comprehensive  O
first  O
of  O
all  O
genotype-phenotype  O
relationship  O

   
we  O
have  O
some  O
as-  O
some  O
increased  O
understanding  O
of  O
how  O
this  O
gene  O
may  O
function  O
and  O
we  O
have  O
a  O
dean-  O
gene  O
dosage  O
effect  O

   
where  O
you  O
have  O
2  O
copies  O
of  O
the  O
mutation  O
a  O
full-blown  O
phenotype  O
1  O
copy  O
of  O
a  O
much  O
milder  O
phenotype  O

   
i  O
wanna  O
also  O
mention  O
that  O
there's  O
the  O
the  O
most  O
common  O
form  O
of  O
autosomal  O
dominant  O
amelogenesis  O
seen  O
in  O
the  O
usa  B-MISC
can  O
have  O
a  O
variable  O
expression  O
but  O
it's  O
due  O
to  O
fam81-  B-MISC
fam83h  I-MISC
mutations  O
these  O
are  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
mutations  O
you  O
find  O
in  O
turkish  B-MISC
and  O
american  B-MISC
families  O

   
and  O
the  O
implication  O
here  O
is  O
although  O
we're  O
still  O
don't  O
understand  O
the  O
gene  O
function  O
how  O
this  O
functions  O
it  O
does  O
have  O
implications  O
for  O
genetic  O
testing  O

30000  O
dollars  O

   
you  O
know  O
so  O
it's  O
not  O
insignificant  O

   
i  O
had  O
a  O
case  O
i  B-MISC
had  O
a  O
patient  O
came  O
in  O
and  O
he  O
had  O
2  O
daughters  O
with  O
ai  B-MISC
and  O
i  B-MISC
said  O
to  O
him  O
you  O
know  O
bill  B-MISC
how  O
are  O
the  O
girls  O
doing  O
and  O
he  O
said  O
well  O
getting  O
ready  O
they're  O
getting  O
ready  O
to  O
graduate  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
said  O
are  O
they  O
going  O
to  O
college  B-MISC
and  O
he  O
said  O
no  O
tom  B-MISC
i'm  I-MISC
putting  O
their  O
money  O
into  O
getting  O
their  O
teeth  O
fixed  O
rather  O
than  O
sending  O
them  O
to  O
school  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
felt  O
as  O
a  O
parent  O
myself  O
that  O
was  O
just  O
a  O
tragic  O
thing  O
to  O
hear  O

   
so  O
it  O
has  O
real  O
implications  O
but  O
the  O
point  O
i'm  B-MISC
trying  O
to  O
make  O
is  O
make  O
is  O
while  O
the  O
money  O
was  O
there  O
previously  O
couldn't  O
prove  O
they  O
had  O
a  O
genetic  O
mutation  O
okay  O

   
so  O
you  O
couldn't  O
access  O
the  O
care  O
dollars  O

   
so  O
there  O
there  O
are  O
some  O
real  O
clinical  O
implications  O
here  O
i  B-MISC
don't  O
know  O
how  O
it  O
is  O
in  O
this  O
state  O

   
now  O
there's  O
other  O
effects  O
for  O
the  O
amelogene-  O
amelogenin  O
gene  O
on  O
chromosome  O
x  B-MISC
you  O
may  O
have  O
a  O
phenomenon  O
called  O
lyonization  O
which  O
is  O
inactivation  O
of  O
the  O
x  B-MISC
chromosome  O
and  O
it's  O
a  O
random  O
inactivation  O

   
so  O
i've  B-MISC
put  O
this  O
here  O
so  O
if  O
you're  O
looking  O
at  O
a  O
f-  O
individual  O
and  O
then  O
getting  O
information  O
about  O
other  O
family  O
members  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
their  O
teeth  O
and  O
specifically  O
to  O
see  O
if  O
their  O
ai  B-MISC
males  O
can  O
be  O
much  O
more  O
severely  O
affected  O
than  O
females  O
who  O
can  O
have  O
inactivation  O
of  O
the  O
chromosome  O
that  O
carries  O
that  O
gene  O
mutation  O

   
so  O
you  O
may  O
see  O
this  O
variable  O
expression  O
even  O
segregating  O
to  O
a  O
family  O

   
now  O
having  O
said  O
that  O
i  B-MISC
want  O
to  O
make  O
the  O
point  O
that  O
i  B-MISC
touched  O
on  O
earlier  O
is  O
that  O
while  O
clinicians  O
dentists  O
are  O
not  O
necessarily  O
experts  O
in  O
genetics  O
and  O
there's  O
a  O
lot  O
to  O
learn  O
although  O
it's  O
a  O
constantly  O
changing  O
and  O
evolving  O
field  O
you  O
are  O
experts  O
in  O
phenotype  O
and  O
there's  O
a  O
great  O
need  O
for  O
your  O
expertise  O

   
i  O
think  O
that  O
when  O
you  O
see  O
conditions  O
that  O
are  O
a  O
little  O
out  O
of  O
the  O
normal  O
you  O
will  O
you  O
will  O
be  O
able  O
to  O
identify  O
them  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
encourage  O
you  O
to  O
delve  O
into  O
those  O
a  O
little  O
deeper  O
either  O
work  O
with  O
others  O
you've  O
got  O
your  O
jim  B-MISC
simmer  I-MISC
jan  I-MISC
hugh  I-MISC
here  O
and  O
others  O
who  O
do  O
genetics  O
but  O
you've  O
got  O
individuals  O
who  O
can  O
help  O
you  O
find  O
the  O
mutations  O
involved  O
in  O
these  O
conditions  O

   
but  O
also  O
you  O
can  O
be  O
involved  O
with  O
genetics  O
counselors  O
to  O
help  O
identify  O
that  O

   
but  O
what  O
i'd  B-MISC
make  O
the  O
plea  O
for  O
is  O
it  O
you  O
get  O
careful  O
clinical  O
observations  O
and  O
report  O
them  O

   
can't  O
tell  O
you  O
how  O
important  O
that's  O
been  O
in  O
may  O
career  O
in  O
figuring  O
out  O
the  O
genetic  O
bases  O
and  O
conditions  O
having  O
careful  O
clinical  O
observations  O

   
i  O
think  O
we  O
went  O
through  O
a  O
period  O
of  O
about  O
20  O
years  O
ago  O
for  O
about  O
10  O
or  O
15  O
years  O
where  O
the  O
emphasis  O
wasn't  O
placed  O
on  O
it  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
placed  O
of  O
such  O
importance  O
and  O
it  O
really  O
is  O
important  O

   
these  O
are  O
just  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
conditions  O
i've  B-MISC
work  O
with  O
over  O
the  O
years  O
and  O
we  O
found  O
gen-  O
alterations  O
in  O
teeth  O
that  O
any  O
dentist  O
would  O
be  O
able  O
to  O
observe  O
and  O
pick  O
up  O

   
but  O
are  O
not  O
so  O
obvious  O
to  O
our  O
physician  O
colleagues  O
or  O
geneticists  O
on  O
as  O
a  O
whole  O

   
now  O
i'm  B-MISC
going  O
to  O
speak  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O
of  O
dentinogenesis  O
imperfecta  O
and  O
again  O
along  O
our  O
theme  O
of  O
how  O
does  O
the  O
genetics  O
help  O
us  O
understand  O
what's  O
happening  O

   
now  O
dentin  O
is  O
made  O
up  O
of  O
three  O
primarily  O
organic  O
molecules  O
dentin  O
sialophosphoprotein  O
collagen  O
1a1  O
collagen  O
1a2  O
these  O
are  O
coded  O
for  O
on  O
different  O
genes  O
and  O
genetic  O
mutations  O
of  O
any  O
one  O
of  O
these  O
can  O
cause  O
dentinogenesis  O
imperfecta  O
or  O
abnormal  O
development  O
of  O
the  O
dentin  O

   
now  O
there  O
are  O
a  O
number  O
of  O
classifications  O
of  O
di  B-MISC
di  I-MISC
that  O
have  O
developed  O
over  O
the  O
years  O

   
and  O
primarily  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
as  O
we  O
look  O
now  O
with  O
respect  O
to  O
what  O
genes  O
are  O
involved  O

   
mutations  O
of  O
dentin  O
sialophosphoprotein  O
dentin  O
sialophosphoprotein  O
gene  O
codes  O
for  O
a  O
protein  O
which  O
is  O
then  O
split  O
into  O
2  O
proteins  O
that  O
functions  O
in  O
enamel-  O
in  O
dentin  O
development  O
and  O
mineralization  O

   
mutations  O
of  O
this  O
gene  O
cause  O
isolated  O
dentinogenesis  O
imperfecta  O

   
however  O
mutations  O
of  O
collagen  O
1a1  O
and  O
collagen  O
1a2  O
which  O
are  O
on  O
2  O
different  O
chromosomes  O
can  O
also  O
cause  O
di  B-MISC

   
they  O
don't  O
have  O
#*  O

   
the  O
collagen  O
genes  O
are  O
big  O
there's  O
over  O
50  O
exons  O
in  O
each  O
of  O
these  O
gens  O
and  O
over  O
500  O
mutations  O
different  O
mutations  O
have  O
been  O
reported  O
#*  O
for  O
each  O
of  O
these  O
genes  O

   
these  O
the  O
phenotypic  O
findings  O
associated  O
with  O
mutations  O
of  O
these  O
genes  O
can  O
be  O
very  O
variable  O
from  O
a  O
very  O
mild  O
phenotype  O
to  O
a  O
very  O
severe  O
in  O
fact  O
a  O
lethal  O
phenotype  O
they  O
can  O
include  O
things  O
like  O
dentinogenesis  O
imperfecta  O
short  O
stature  O
hearing  O
loss  O
blue  O
sclera  O
mitral  O
valve  O
prolapse  O
aortic  O
so  O
cardiovascular  O
problems  O
bone  O
problems  O
okay  O
fractures  O

   
@void  O

   
the  O
challenge  O
has  O
been  O
in  O
the  O
past  O
somebody  O
presented  O
with  O
di  B-MISC
did  O
they  O
have  O
isolated  O
di  B-MISC
was  O
it  O
due  O
to  O
dentin  O
sialophosphoprotein  O
mutation  O
or  O
did  O
they  O
have  O
a  O
form  O
of  O
di  B-MISC
that  O
had  O
syndromic  O
manifestations  O
and  O
let  O
me  O
show  O
you  O
a  O
case  O
that  O
we  O
had  O
a  O
few  O
years  O
ago  O
with  O
doctor  O
paulus  B-MISC
referred  O
family  O
members  O
with  O
dentinogenesis  O
imperfecta  O
that  O
was  O
a  O
chief  O
complaint  O

   
we  O
started  O
examining  O
family  O
members  O
we  O
found  O
that  O
some  O
of  O
them  O
who  O
were  O
affected  O
also  O
had  O
joint  O
hyper-extensibility  O
bone  O
fractures  O
increased  O
bone  O
fractures  O
and  O
they  O
had  O
severe  O
joint  O
pain  O
the  O
people  O
with  O
di  B-MISC
reported  O
this  O
joint  O
pain  O
which  O
i  B-MISC
don't  O
think  O
had  O
been  O
reported  O
previously  O

   
bottom  O
line  O
is  O
we  O
did  O
genetic  O
linkage  O
studies  O
and  O
localized  O
the  O
gene  O
in  O
chromosome  O
17  O
so  O
we  O
knew  O
as  O
a  O
collagen  O
1a1  O
gene  O
we  O
sequenced  O
the  O
gene  O
and  O
found  O
a  O
mutation  O
in  O
exon  O
32  O

   
so  O
we  O
had  O
this  O
specific  O
mutation  O

   
and  O
we  O
know  O
that  O
this  O
mutation  O
is  O
associated  O
with  O
dentinogenesis  O
imperfecta  O
some  O
other  O
clinical  O
findings  O

   
okay  O
changes  O
a  O
glycine  O
to  O
a  O
cysteine  O
okay  O
nucleotide  O
#*  O

   
and  O
now  O
we  O
have  O
a  O
genotype-phenotype  O
correlation  O
if  O
someone  O
else  O
is  O
identified  O
with  O
this  O
type  O
of  O
mutation  O
they  O
they  O
know  O
what  O
the  O
phenotypic  O
findings  O
associated  O
with  O
that  O
for  O
instance  O
they  O
don't  O
need  O
to  O
go  O
through  O
a  O
search  O
of  O
that  O
type  O
of  O
thing  O
and  O
the  O
clinicians  O
can  O
be  O
on  O
the  O
lookout  O
for  O
that  O

   
but  O
having  O
that  O
genotype-phenotype  O
information  O
is  O
critical  O
and  O
i'm  B-MISC
going  O
to  O
illustrate  O
it  O
with  O
this  O
example  O

   
there's  O
another  O
mutation  O
of  O
the  O
same  O
aminoacid  O
same  O
gene  O
same  O
aminoacid  O
but  O
the  O
next  O
nucleotide  O
over  O
glycine  O
changes  O
to  O
an  O
aspartic  O
acid  O
the  O
phenotype  O
associated  O
with  O
this  O
is  O
neonatal  O
lethal  O
it's  O
very  O
severe  O

   
and  O
the  O
point  O
i'm  B-MISC
trying  O
to  O
make  O
here  O
is  O
although  O
as  O
high-throughput  O
sequencing  O
methodologies  O
come  O
on  O
board  O
and  O
i'll  B-MISC
show  O
you  O
an  O
example  O
in  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O
of  O
where  O
it  O
was  O
applied  O
you  O
can  O
now  O
sequence  O
all  O
the  O
exons  O
in  O
somebody's  O
genomes  O
in  O
about  O
25  O
hours  O
get  O
the  O
data  O
back  O

   
then  O
the  O
challenge  O
is  O
what  O
what's  O
the  O
information  O
telling  O
us  O

   
you  O
need  O
to  O
have  O
we  O
need  O
to  O
develop  O
more  O
robust  O
databases  O
of  O
phenotypic  O
findings  O
with  O
genetic  O
alterations  O
to  O
be  O
able  O
to  O
interpret  O
these  O
types  O
of  O
findings  O

   
now  O
with  O
dentinogenesis  O
imperfecta  O
specifically  O
with  O
dspp  B-MISC
it  O
was  O
possible  O
to  O
sequence  O
in  O
the  O
past  O
collagen  O
1a1  O
it  O
cost  O
about  O
5000  O
dollars  O
it's  O
less  O
than  O
1000  O
dollars  O
now  O
collagen  O
1a2  O
you  O
could  O
sequence  O
it  O
was  O
about  O
5000  O
dollars  O
significantly  O
less  O
now  O

   
and  O
for  O
dspp  B-MISC
it  O
wasn't  O
possible  O
to  O
sequence  O
the  O
whole  O
gene  O

   
what  O
happens  O
is  O
there's  O
an  O
area  O
of  O
the  O
exon  O
5  O
which  O
is  O
highly  O
repetitive  O
and  O
there's  O
210  O
repeats  O
of  O
sarin  O
sarin  O
aspartic  O
acid  O
okay  O
very  O
hydrophilic  O

   
and  O
it's  O
a  O
unique  O
biological  O
protein  O
okay  O

   
and  O
molecularly  O
it  O
just  O
wasn't  O
possible  O
to  O
sequence  O
through  O
this  O

   
and  O
that  O
was  O
the  O
challenge  O
so  O
what  O
happened  O
is  O
people  O
will  O
sequence  O
the  O
parts  O
of  O
dspp  B-MISC
they  O
could  O
and  O
then  O
if  O
they  O
didn't  O
find  O
a  O
mutation  O
reports  O
were  O
well  O
it's  O
not  O
dspp  B-MISC
it's  O
got  O
to  O
be  O
another  O
gene  O

   
no  O
it  O
wasn't  O
we  O
just  O
weren't  O
being  O
we  O
weren't  O
sequencing  O
the  O
whole  O
gene  O

   
so  O
in  O
about  O
2007  O
2008  O
larry  O
fisher  I-MISC
and  O
di  B-MISC
mcknight  I-MISC
were  O
working  O
with  O
us  O
and  O
they  O
developed  O
a  O
technique  O
to  O
sequence  O
through  O
this  O
highly  O
repetitive  O
region  O

   
what  O
we  O
found  O
is  O
for  O
a  O
number  O
of  O
cases  O
and  O
now  O
there's  O
more  O
by  O
now  O
but  O
the  O
majority  O
of  O
cases  O
where  O
we  O
looked  O
at  O
the  O
mutations  O
were  O
actually  O
in  O
this  O
highly  O
repetitive  O
region  O

   
okay  O
so  O
broadly  O
they  O
were  O
in  O
broad  O
strokes  O
mutations  O
that  O
were  O
inside  O
this  O
highly  O
repetitive  O
region  O
which  O
changed  O
the  O
protein  O
produced  O
protein  O
from  O
a  O
hydrophilic  O
repeat  O
to  O
a  O
hydrophobic  O
repeat  O
which  O
function  O
very  O
differently  O
precipitated  O
out  O
and  O
was  O
non-functional  O

   
so  O
we  O
had  O
sort  O
of  O
two  O
classes  O
of  O
mutations  O
that  O
was  O
important  O
for  O
understanding  O
etiology  O
and  O
i'll  B-MISC
show  O
you  O
how  O
that's  O
affected  O
development  O
or  O
the  O
move  O
to  O
develop  O
novel  O
treatments  O
in  O
a  O
second  O

   
but  O
the  O
other  O
thing  O
that  O
it  O
did  O
is  O
it  O
changed  O
clinical  O
the  O
ability  O
to  O
clinically  O
test  O
for  O
these  O
individuals  O

   
so  O
now  O
if  O
an  O
individual  O
presented  O
with  O
di  B-MISC
you  O
could  O
go  O
to  O
in  O
sequence  O
all  O
three  O
of  O
these  O
genes  O
and  O
determine  O
what  O
the  O
root  O
cause  O
was  O

   
if  O
they  O
had  O
dspp  B-MISC
mutations  O
you  O
knew  O
this  O
was  O
probably  O
the  O
only  O
phenotype  O

   
if  O
they  O
had  O
mutations  O
of  O
these  O
other  O
genes  O
you  O
may  O
want  O
to  O
have  O
a  O
more  O
thorough  O
evaluation  O
of  O
that  O
individual  O
and  O
perhaps  O
other  O
affected  O
family  O
members  O

   
so  O
clinically  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
that  O
was  O
significant  O
for  O
diagnosis  O
and  O
for  O
nosology  O

   
but  O
something  O
else  O
we  O
found  O
is  O
you  O
know  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
sort  O
of  O
in  O
the  O
past  O
we  O
assumed  O
that  O
if  O
it  O
was  O
only  O
di  B-MISC
and  O
no  O
other  O
findings  O
it  O
had  O
to  O
be  O
a  O
dspp  B-MISC
mutation  O

   
and  O
here  O
i'm  B-MISC
showing  O
you  O
two  O
cases  O
they're  O
both  O
from  O
large  O
families  O
i  B-MISC
haven't  O
shown  O
the  O
pedigree  O
here  O
large  O
autosomal  O
dominant  O
family  O
segregating  O
dentinogenesis  O
imperfecta  O
was  O
the  O
chief  O
complaint  O

   
we  O
went  O
into  O
these  O
famil-  O
we  O
went  O
in  O
in  O
sequence  O
and  O
found  O
a  O
collagen  O
1a1  O
mutation  O
a  O
novel  O
mutation  O
in  O
this  O
family  O
and  O
we  O
found  O
a  O
collagen  O
1a2  O
mutation  O
is  O
responsible  O
for  O
di  B-MISC
in  O
this  O
family  O

   
as  O
we  O
did  O
more  O
thorough  O
analysis  O
we  O
found  O
that  O
actually  O
in  O
this  O
family  O
which  O
is  O
from  O
brazil  B-MISC
i'm  I-MISC
sorry  O
this  O
family's  O
from  O
turkey  B-MISC
they  O
had  O
short  O
stature  O

   
so  O
the  O
affected  O
individuals  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
population  O
norms  O
and  O
even  O
their  O
family  O
norms  O
were  O
a  O
few  O
inches  O
shorter  O
slightly  O
shorter  O

   
that's  O
the  O
only  O
other  O
phenotypic  O
finding  O
that  O
we  O
found  O
very  O
mild  O
but  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
main  O
finding  O

   
and  O
in  O
this  O
case  O
they  O
had  O
dentinogenesis  O
imperfecta  O
the  O
only  O
other  O
finding  O
we  O
could  O
find  O
in  O
all  O
affected  O
individuals  O
was  O
this  O
wormian  O
lambdoidal  O
suture  O
okay  O

   
#*ed  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
we  O
were  O
doing  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
phenotyping  O
so  O
you  O
wouldn't  O
normally  O
perhaps  O
have  O
the  O
opportunity  O
to  O
do  O
this  O
but  O
my  O
point  O
is  O
that  O
individuals  O
with  O
di  B-MISC
can  O
have  O
mild  O
cases  O
and  O
not  O
show  O
other  O
features  O

   
and  O
there  O
have  O
been  O
cases  O
of  O
individu-  O
in  O
families  O
with  O
di  B-MISC
due  O
to  O
collagen  O
mutations  O
where  O
it's  O
variable  O
expressions  O
so  O
one  O
individual  O
the  O
main  O
finding  O
may  O
be  O
di  B-MISC
and  O
in  O
not  O
much  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
vascular  O
or  O
bone  O
findings  O
but  O
in  O
other  O
family  O
members  O
that  O
have  O
the  O
mutation  O
they  O
have  O
more  O
significant  O
in  O
fact  O
with  O
real  O
health  O
consequences  O
apart  O
from  O
dental  O
for  O
their  O
vasculature  O
or  O
bone  O
findings  O

   
so  O
again  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
the  O
clinical  O
significance  O
isn't  O
just  O
developing  O
a  O
diagnosis  O
in  O
nojob-  O
nosology  O
but  O
as  O
i  B-MISC
mentioned  O
before  O
certain  O
individuals  O
can  O
have  O
access  O
to  O
care  O
and  O
in  O
medicine  O
in  O
general  O
i  B-MISC
know  O
reimbursement  O
patterns  O
are  O
different  O
but  O
if  O
you  O
have  O
genetic  O
diseases  O
you're  O
covered  O
and  O
now  O
it's  O
more  O
you  O
can't  O
be  O
discriminated  O
against  O
but  O
we  O
need  O
to  O
come  O
forward  O
with  O
the  O
dental  O
aspects  O
of  O
these  O
types  O
of  O
traits  O
because  O
as  O
we'll  O
see  O
they're  O
not  O
insignificant  O

   
now  O
i  B-MISC
want  O
to  O
mention  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O
about  O
how  O
understanding  O
the  O
etiology  O
can  O
help  O
advance  O
development  O
of  O
novel  O
etiologic  O
based  O
treatments  O

   
as  O
another  O
part  O
of  O
my  O
research  O
we  O
have  O
identified  O
genes  O
involved  O
in  O
certain  O
kidney  O
diseases  O
and  O
in  O
fact  O
we  O
found  O
genes  O
that  O
causes  O
a  O
type  O
of  O
kidney  O
disease  O
whereas  O
a  O
protein  O
was  O
made  O
that  O
for  O
that  O
destroyed  O
cells  O
with  O
the  O
ascending  O
loop  O
of  O
henle  B-MISC

   
so  O
basically  O
this  O
mutant  O
protein  O
destroyed  O
the  O
kidneys  O
over  O
time  O
end  O
stage  O
renal  O
disease  O
and  O
death  O
if  O
you  O
didn't  O
have  O
a  O
transplant  O

   
but  O
we  O
also  O
found  O
out  O
is  O
that  O
mutation  O
caused  O
it  O
what  O
we  O
call  O
an  O
endoplasmic  O
reticulum  O
store  O
disease  O
the  O
mutant  O
protein  O
got  O
clogged  O
up  O
in  O
the  O
endoplasmic  O
reticulum  O
and  O
killed  O
the  O
cell  O

   
we're  O
able  O
to  O
also  O
use  O
molecular  O
chaperones  O
to  O
move  O
that  O
mutant  O
protein  O
out  O
of  O
the  O
cell  O
and  O
prevent  O
cell  O
death  O

   
so  O
we  O
thought  O
gee  O
could  O
there  O
be  O
correlations  O
with  O
certain  O
dental  O
diseases  O

   
and  O
in  O
fact  O
there  O
are  O

   
so  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
case  O
for  O
dentinogenesis  O
imperfecta  O
and  O
what  O
i  B-MISC
want  O
to  O
show  O
you  O
here  O
could  O
we  O
dim  O
the  O
lights  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O
please  O

   
is  O
it  O
possible  O

   
no  O
okay  O

   
what  O
i  B-MISC
want  O
to  O
try  O
and  O
show  O
here  O
is  O
so  O
we  O
have  O
individuals  O
i  B-MISC
showed  O
you  O
before  O
the  O
the  O
dspp  B-MISC
gene  O
so  O
i'm  B-MISC
not  O
talking  O
about  O
that  O
repetitive  O
region  O
of  O
exon  O
5  O

   
but  O
in  O
in  O
earlier  O
exons  O
1  O
and  O
2  O
particularly  O
2  O
there  O
are  O
a  O
number  O
of  O
mutations  O

   
and  O
these  O
cause  O
problems  O
in  O
protein  O
folding  O
and  O
transport  O
of  O
the  O
protein  O

   
so  O
what  O
we  O
have  O
here  O
normally  O
dspp  B-MISC
is  O
produced  O
in  O
a  O
cell  O
and  O
this  O
shows  O
a  O
cell  O
#dspp  O
is  O
produced  O
and  O
this  O
is  O
stained  O
with  O
an  O
antibody  O

   
this  O
is  O
an  O
antibody  O
standing  O
for  O
the  O
endoplasmic  O
reticulum  O
organelle  O
in  O
the  O
in  O
the  O
cells  O

   
this  O
is  O
an  O
overlay  O
and  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
the  O
endoplasmic  O
reticulum  O
and  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
the  O
dspp  B-MISC
being  O
produced  O
by  O
the  O
cell  O

   
and  O
it's  O
excreted  O
we  O
could  O
detect  O
this  O
in  O
the  O
medium  O
around  O
in  O
the  O
cell  O
culture  O

   
this  O
is  O
cells  O
that  O
have  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
mutations  O
from  O
dspp  B-MISC

   
you  O
see  O
the  O
dspp  B-MISC
is  O
produced  O
but  O
it's  O
retained  O
in  O
the  O
endoplasmic  O
reticulum  O
and  O
here  O
all  O
the  O
dspp  B-MISC
is  O
in  O
the  O
endoplasmic  O
reticulum  O
you  O
don't  O
see  O
it  O
expressed  O
outside  O
the  O
cell  O

   
and  O
what  O
we're  O
able  O
to  O
do  O
with  O
this  O
4-phenolbutyrate  O
and  O
also  O
we  O
used  O
colchicine  O
so  O
there's  O
a  O
number  O
of  O
molecular  O
chaperones  O
we're  O
able  O
to  O
treat  O
these  O
mutant  O
cell  O
with  O
these  O
chemical  O
chaperones  O
and  O
actually  O
get  O
the  O
mutant  O
protein  O
to  O
be  O
excreted  O
out  O
okay  O

   
and  O
that's  O
what  O
we  O
show  O
here  O
we  O
show  O
different  O
mutations  O

   
these  O
are  O
different  O
mutations  O
of  O
the  O
dspp  B-MISC
gene  O
this  O
is  O
an  O
empty  O
vector  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
wild-type  O
the  O
cell  O
with  O
a  O
wild-type  O
dspp  B-MISC

   
and  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
the  O
dspp  B-MISC
is  O
secreted  O
versus  O
in  O
these  O
mutants  O
much  O
less  O
and  O
in  O
fact  O
some  O
cases  O
no  O
dspp  B-MISC
is  O
secreted  O

   
when  O
we  O
treat  O
them  O
with  O
this  O
molecular  O
chaperone  O
we  O
can  O
get  O
the  O
mutated  O
protein  O
secreted  O
out  O
and  O
in  O
other  O
studies  O
we're  O
able  O
to  O
demonstrate  O
we  O
in  O
fact  O
increase  O
the  O
longevity  O
of  O
the  O
cells  O
okay  O
so  O
the  O
cells  O
instead  O
of  O
going  O
through  O
apoptosis  O
and  O
dying  O
we're  O
able  O
to  O
keep  O
them  O
healthy  O
and  O
functional  O

   
so  O
what  O
i  B-MISC
want  O
to  O
point  O
out  O
is  O
to  O
understanding  O
the  O
molecular  O
defect  O
you  O
can  O
open  O
up  O
the  O
caveat  O
it  O
perhaps  O
novel  O
developmental  O
treatments  O
but  O
it's  O
not  O
a  O
one-size-fits-all  O

   
and  O
in  O
cancer  O
genetics  O
the  O
cancer  O
genetics  O
has  O
been  O
applied  O
to  O
companion  O
testing  O
and  O
you  O
may  O
or  O
may  O
not  O
know  O
but  O
for  O
certain  O
specific  O
types  O
of  O
cancer  O
particular  O
epithelial  O
types  O
of  O
cancer  O
solid  O
tumors  O
based  O
on  O
the  O
genetic  O
mutation  O
you  O
can  O
be  O
tested  O
and  O
if  O
you  O
have  O
that  O
mutation  O
you  O
can  O
have  O
very  O
very  O
very  O
high  O
success  O
rates  O
for  O
treatments  O

   
it's  O
amazing  O
so  O
again  O
the  O
treatment  O
doesn't  O
work  O
for  O
for  O
certain  O
types  O
of  O
cancers  O
it  O
doesn't  O
work  O
for  O
say  O
colon  O
cancer  O
won't  O
work  O
for  O
everybody  O
with  O
colon  O
cancer  O
but  O
with  O
certain  O
types  O
of  O
cancer  O
based  O
on  O
the  O
genetic  O
etiology  O
you  O
can  O
have  O
specific  O
treatments  O
that  O
are  O
very  O
very  O
successful  O

   
i  O
think  O
it's  O
a  O
real  O
paradigm  O
for  O
health  O
care  O
in  O
general  O

   
@garbage-until-the-end  O

   
now  O
and  O
talking  O
about  O
this  O
is  O
going  O
to  O
think  O
type  O
part  O
of  O
the  O
torque  O
was  O
the  O
future  O
we  O
getting  O
genetic  O
information  O
mention  O

   
a  O
thousand  O
conditions  O
and  O
daily  O
the  O
genes  O
involved  O
my  O
daily  O
entire  O

are  O

how  O
we  O
can  O
use  O
this  O
information  O
metal  O
first  O

on  O
a  O

with  O

as  O

some  O

products  O
mention  O
or  O
more  O
that  O
genomic  O
the  O
real  O

so  O
it's  O
not  O
just  O
rotations  O
according  O
reasons  O
genes  O
cause  O
disease  O
and  O
in  O
fact  O

   
beg  O
to  O
is  O
that  O
only  O
about  O
two  O
percent  O
of  O

the  O

about  O

so  O
was  O
and  O
we  O
just  O
didn't  O
understand  O
how  O

now  O
really  O
understand  O
feel  O
how  O
functioning  O
much  O
more  O

there  O

a  O

that  O

most  O

we  O

make  O
i  B-MISC

a  O

can  O

much  O
as  O

parrot  O
i  B-MISC
for  O
complex  O
disease  O
is  O
that  O
many  O
many  O
more  O
genes  O
contribute  O
to  O
them  O
then  O
we  O
for  O

   
this  O
so  O
for  O
compared  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
we  O
can  O
look  O
at  O
this  O
is  O
chronic  O
periodontitis  O
and  O
then  O
in  O
second  O
we  O
look  O
at  O
maintainer  O
forms  O
disease  O
patterns  O
ever  O
syndrome  O

   
that  O
look  O
at  O
a  O
larger  O
population  O
sample  O
say  O
city  B-MISC
chicago  I-MISC
a  O
report  O
that  O
individuals  O
within  O
the  O
population  O
outside  O
of  O
a  O

some  O
really  O
train  O
something  O
very  O
short  O
with  O
polymorphism  O
of  O
different  O
types  O
of  O
some  O
of  O
different  O
forms  O
child  O
is  O
so  O
you  O
real  O
training  O
very  O
rare  O
but  O
this  O
case  O
cause  O
rotations  O

so  O
a  O

really  O

you  O
your  O

that  O
one  O
rotation  O
authorized  O
all  O
development  O
pat-  O
where  O

high  O

   
several  O
for  O

so  O
we  O
had  O
this  O
paradigm  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
it's  O
holding  O
looks  O
like  O
for  O

as  O
well  O
you  O
think  O
about  O

thing  O
there's  O
the  O
most  O
common  O

a  O

a  O

many  O

   
each  O

but  O
there  O
are  O
rare  O
for  O

which  O
many  O
daily  O

but  O
to  O

globally  O
there  O
can  O
look  O
at  O

three  O

so  O

   
but  O
there's  O
actually  O
we  O
look  O
at  O
now  O
we're  O
able  O
sequence  O

on  O
a  O

a  O
much  O
more  O

have  O
from  O
some  O

okay  O
the  O
question  O
is  O
what  O
the  O

about  O

have  O
to  O

from  O
your  O

for  O

   
_twenty_  O

which  O
is  O
normally  O

okay  O
variations  O

that  O

but  O
the  O
pointer  O
here  O
as  O
were  O
able  O
to  O
introduce  O
is  O
another  O
study  O
identifying  O
individuals  O
over  O

and  O
you  O
get  O

try  O
to  O
show  O

historically  O
we  O
done  O

this  O
going  O
to  O

now  O

much  O
a  O

being  O
found  O
is  O
that  O
there's  O

there's  O

as  O

that  O

end  O
of  O
have  O
the  O
type  O
of  O
information  O
gonna  O
say  O
what's  O
the  O

and  O
again  O
that's  O
remember  O
we  O
need  O
to  O
really  O
start  O
not  O
staff  O
continue  O

   
a  O
type  O
populations  O
people  O
have  O
this  O
genetic  O
information  O
we  O
can  O
determine  O
what  O
means  O
stress  O
a  O
parrot  O
these  O
are  O
two  O
cases  O
i've  B-MISC
the  O
last  O
years  O
that  O
had  O

their  O
presented  O
the  O
editor-in-chief  O
of  O

overgrowth  O
with  O

but  O
performed  O
genetic  O

not  O
the  O

have  O

that  O
produce  O
about  O
_fifty_  O

   
percent  O

now  O
so  O
this  O
is  O
what  O
becoming  O
impact  O
reports  O
in  O
the  O
future  O
think  O
that  O
in  O
a  O
great  O

brief  O
mention  O
complex  O
genetic  O

retro  O
are  O
the  O
most  O

problems  O
okay  O
thing  O

   
response  O
things  O
i  B-MISC
can't  O
ask  O
you  O
guys  O
a  O
big  O
city  B-MISC
in  O
dentistry  O
we  O
can  O
take  O
a  O
chronic  O
tied  O
caries  O

   
multiple  O
genes  O
environment  O
fact  O
important  O
thing  O
is  O
realize  O
complex  O
diseases  O
that  O
hundreds  O
of  O
thousands  O
and  O
genes  O
are  O
gonna  O
be  O
involved  O
and  O
contribution  O
the  O
maxil-  O
contribution  O
for  O
placement  O
these  O
complex  O
trays  O

   
or  O
of  O
about  O
point  O
_five_  O
percent  O
maxil-  O
contribution  O
of  O
a  O

understand  O
understand  O
more  O
than  O
currently  O
understanding  O
one  O
genetic  O

   
separate  O
since  O
for  O
sinus  O
complex  O
diseases  O
just  O
as  O
help  O
clinically  O
at  O
this  O
point  O
time  O

   
i  O
mentioned  O
then  O
code  O
on  O
the  O
just  O
how  O
that  O
change  O
understanding  O
encourage  O
hold  O
up  O
the  O
code  O
our  O
third  O
according  O
paper  O
last  O
mouth  O
and  O
it's  O
amazing  O
really  O
changing  O
understanding  O
corporation  O
that  O
that  O
was  O
another  O
project  O
as  O
early  O

   
change  O
rod  O
complex  O

in  O
that  O
many  O
many  O
many  O
working  O
with  O
for  O
affect  O
for  O
so  O
last  O
three  O
minutes  O
i  B-MISC
just  O
want  O
a  O
finish  O
up  O
by  O
talking  O
about  O
how  O
thinking  O
about  O
genetics  O
and  O
public  O
health  O
talk  O
about  O
diagnostics  O
etiology  O
but  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
interventions  O
stratified  O

   
mention  O
many  O
conditions  O
and  O
the  O
germs  O
for  O
these  O
starting  O
to  O
be  O
identified  O
okay  O
how  O
we  O
can  O
use  O
this  O
information  O

   
the  O
purpose  O
perspective  O
i  B-MISC
put  O
out  O
this  O
was  O
lastly  O
proper  O

ventilation  O
metal  O
shell  O
on  O
in  O
intensive  O
care  O
where  O
significant  O
number  O
of  O
addition  O
genetic  O
diseases  O
of  O
cause  O

   
there  O
are  O
five  O
case  O
were  O
babies  O
broad  O

   
what  O
they  O
had  O
their  O

were  O
sequence  O
and  O
_twenty-five_  O
hours  O
read  O
another  O
_twenty-five_  O
hours  O
a  O
case  O
of  O
_fifty_  O
our  O
to  O
take  O
that  O
a  O

their  O

analyses  O
causes  O
about  O
_thirteen_  O
father  O
our  O
for  O

across  O
a  O
continuum  O
going  O
as  O
a  O
rush  O

   
and  O
they're  O
able  O
to  O
identify  O
genetic  O
basis  O
of  O
_four_  O
_five_  O
conditions  O
okay  O
so  O
this  O
is  O
really  O
coming  O
the  O
precious  B-MISC

coming  O
here  O

these  O

we  O
