thank you generous introduction 
 this is showing normal blood pressure for whom americans and as you can see with age and with the the differences between genders and so you can see female male but anyway this is something that we consider normal 
 so i have sort of a new definition for what a wellness continuum is it's usually predicated on diet nutrition and exercise and physical activity 
 we now propose a triangle with sleep and airway hygiene and i was so glad to hear the talk this morning about ancestral sleep something and very much interested in helping develop 
 sorry to interrupt but you don't need the you don't need to hold #* 
 i don't need this yeah i've got i just like holding a microphone 
 so in stress level figures into this continuum somewhere and i i don't quite know where i think it modulates all of them 
 diet nutrition is by directional i mean comfort food right we can alleviate stress with it and we can cause stress and inflammation by over-nutrition wrong nutrition non paleo-nutrition 
 same thing with exercise some people do it to relax but it also can if it's not done correctly you can put stresses in the system 
 sleep and airway hygiene hygiene does not mean clean hygiene means health okay so dental hygiene clean teeth that's one component of hygiene 
 hygiene sleep and airway hygiene is something that we are now teaching dental hygienists to in addition to cleaning teeth we want you to assess airway health 
 so anyway normal does not equal healthy alright normal means average 
 and and i'm preaching to the choir obviously you know this but this is gonna be on the internet and are hoping our dental and medical colleagues will be learning from this as well so some of the stuff i don't want you think oh he doesn't know we don't know that we know that 
 well anyway how about this how about an ancestral norm 
 now i'm i'm just using blood pressure but it depends on the environment that you're subjected to that determines what is normal and normal equal healthy well 1 20 over 80 probably is is healthy but it probably should be or genomically we have the potential to have lower blood pressure 
 but we're an industrialized society so that's that's as good as it's gonna get for now but maybe when we have our impact on society which we will and we are maybe these 10 years know they might revise these 
 well the same thing exists in orthodontics okay 
 the norms that have been established from the nineteen fifties by two white guys who took a couple of kids that they thought were good looking and they were powerful 
 and these are the norms they're mainly by a guy named steiner and downs and these are really the foundation of the norms are used by most orthodontists look at your kids and they're their misdiagnosing 
 i'm not indicting the orthodontic profession in fact you will hear later from scott that western dentistry is a wonderful thing it does the best that it can 
 we want to push it in a direction that can help with be #* all that #* can be by having it be more ancestrally focused well orthodontic norms are leading to kids being treated too late and be treated inappropriately 
 if orthodontics was only about cosmetics this really wouldn't be that big a deal i got beautifully straight teeth but i had teeth pulled out with a headgear and need jaw surgery 
 i'm not overweight and i snore like a train so it's you know and that can be damaging to end in organ damage 
 so what we're saying is what is a new norm that we can use for our little kids 
 that's a 500 year-old palate of one of our museum specimens okay and what i want you to pay attention to is this this is the back nose the posterior naris this is your nasal septum coming all the way from the front this is where air enters into your throat the pharynx okay it correlates with the with and the depth and the length of the palate 
 okay and that's that's you know anyone who wants a reference on anything i'm not putting them up here but i have references on everything i say you can google anything i say i am not lying about or exaggerating about anything it's all scientifically medically defensible 
 so anyway we're proposing a new norm for orthodontics okay 
 and this is pretty much something that we we go back and a lot of this was covered in other lectures today 
 but you know about 2 and a half million years ago that's genus homo when it when it came into being 
 40000 years that's europeans cromagnons and then we say 10000 it's probably 15000 when agriculture and domestication of plants started in different places but we use that 10 to 12 thousand thing but it's changing all the time 
 but that's when we start to see appreciable increases in tooth decay 
 now when i first heard this i thought it was a lie because i would have learned about it in dental school huh right this is like paul simon when i think back and all the crap i learned in high school 
 well #* some other things i didn't learn in dental school was this because i didn't have to take any anthropology or revolutionary biology is basic science again into school none of us did the physicians don't nobody in healthcare does 
 it's not required it should be if it is like according to randy nessie it's as if an engineer could be call themselves an engineer without having to take a course in physics 
 that's how bad it is 
 anyway this is my academy of pediatric dentistry and you can see this is our policy statements and practice guidelines everything and they have this little thing here it's it all has to do with early gum disease early childhood tooth decay early gum disease and tooth decay tartar and that's something that al is going to talk about later we think of plaque as being intrinsically bad 
 he is gonna talk about good plaque okay 
 we find 15000 year-old plaque fossilized it's called calculus 
 and there's no gum disease or bone loss or anything associated with it so i really looking forward to what he has to say 
 nothing about malocclusion 
 okay are we we do in our statement now we have a practice guideline for sleep apnea 
 which is good and we have all kinds of things about orthodontics but really nothing connecting the 2 and that's what i am trying to do with my research and by talking to groups like you 
 if we can end childhood obesity why is it that we can't end tooth decay 
 okay and you you really just don't hear it 
 well because childhood obesity is a nutritionally modulated condition it can be prevented 
 michelle obama she said we can end it in a generation she she's i think she's technically right it's practically not too realistic but it could be done hypothetically well so too can tooth decay because it involves bacteria but it is a diet modulated disease so we could end it because at one time we used to not really appreciably have it 
 there's always been tooth decay 
 so it didn't start with agriculture that you can go thou- hundreds of thousands of years and find tooth decay but it wasn't appreciable 
 there wasn't much 
 okay honey can cause tooth decay and we know our ancestors ate honey 
 but what would dentists do when there is no tooth decay 
 i have a very busy practice in chicago and less than 10 percent of what i do generating income providing services has anything to do tooth decay 
 i'm sort of known as a sugar scoundrel 
 i i tell parents politely look if your if your kid if you're not gonna you know eat the stuff out of the house this might not be the practice for you 
 i don't think i've lost patients before but not for that most parents love it that that i they were strict such as me and my partner and my my team my staff 
 so nutrition counseling again the next 2 speakers are gonna talk a little bit about that they're very proactive with it i have a dietetics a nutrition dietetics degree and i don't do near the degree of counseling that these guys do and #* got some amazing forms 
 this is people have been exploring this this was in the journal of science in 2012 it was a focus group an extant focus group at duke university 
 and i was on a panel with 8 anthropologists and 8 dentists and we came up with this and there's been some articles that look at malocclusion from an evolutionary perspective 
 so other people are curious about this 
 one of the things that happens 
 i don't know why it's the whole space or some- i don't know if that an av guy can do it 
 because everything is squed over 
 well anyway what happens is 200 thousand 250 thous- 300 thousand years as hunter-gatherers right 
 our jaws were wider more forward and more less vertical 
 okay what happened with agriculture and industry is that the jaws have got narrower more retrusive and vertical they've fallen down 
 this is a u- the universal phenotypes of a modernization 
 if you take an extant hunter-gatherer 
 and move them to the big city in one generation you will see crowding that can't be genetic this is an epigenetic phenomenon 
 so this is what happens 
 now it has implications for apnea the airway and does everyone know that add adhd when you clear up the sleep and improve the breathing usually the symptoms go away from add adhd and you can many kids we've taken off ritalin just by improving their sleep by changing the shape of the jaw some as young as 2 years old 
 okay i'm doing orthodontics on 2 year olds 
 and the most of them referred from pulmonary specialist ents pediatricians let's let's let boyd try nothing else has worked 
 we took the tonsils out and the adenoids grew back and the kid's apnea is bad or worse alright 
 this is something that is taught in orthodontic programs and orthodontic textbooks that a retrognatic chin is a normal trait and you can see it in utero 
 okay and here it is in the textbook but that's just not true 
 it's not true there's not a shred of evidence for it 
 and what we have found in our samples at the penn museum is that skulls fetal cadaver skulls before the industrial revolution are all bimaxillary protrusive okay 
 that implies that they come into the world with the potential the morphology for a healthy airway 
 okay the front of the airway is the face the back of the face is the airway we don't say craniofacial anymore we say cranial respiratory 
 what happens in the face the palatal-facial sutural complex you have fontanelle soft spots all over the place in your cranial respiratory complex 
 so this is the difference and we just superimposed a couple it's not terribly scientific but 
 and this width i told you correlates with the ability to get air through the paranasal sinus complex into the pharynx which to the lungs to the brain 
 so there you go you've got a narrow jaw you got a narrow posterior naris 
 a wider jaw wider airway less resistance 
 treatment of apnea and yes little kids get apnea lots of them 
 and little kids right now the treatment of choice is tonsil and adenoid removal 
 or they cut a hole in your throat and i've got mainly syndromic kids that come in with tracheotomies okay 
 or maxillomandibular advancement look at that what in medicine do you know has a greater than 90 percent success rate 
 every patient by virtue of the the the name a procedure that will fix it maxillo- maxilla mandibular advancement that means pre-surgically they are maxillomandibular retrusive 
 and it starts probably in utero certainly while they're in their baby teeth 
 okay this is one of my patients this is her when she was like 5 and here she was 2 and a half months ago in intensive care for 3 days okay 
 her dad is a dentist and did not know how to do for her when she was this age 
 so that's what had to be done 
 he did know what to do for her the little sister 
 and she did need jaw surgery and they now look like well their their their airways look remark- #* 
 this is her where the adenoids are it's very narrow should be really wide and it's not so she got her tonsils out look how wide it is but look how narrow it is here 
 and on 3 dimensional cone beam you can see it's is really nice up here but it should be all the way down like this okay 
 there she is now after her surgery 
 cured tmj anxiety depression apnea 
 just really she was tired all the time 
 she had a degenerative jaw joint tmj and it's all fixed okay 
 there she is today 
 okay now i know this kid really well that's my daughter 
 and you when we drove to saint louis to get the surgery you were thought she was going to get a manicure she was so excited she didn't care about the intensive care and being on the table for 10 hours 
 here's another patient that my partner janet pannaralla does all the adults 
 so she and i don't treat my own kids so she did all the orthognatic set-up for this 
 but we have people flying in from all over the country to get this done 
 i don't we also you know this is a last resort this is a rescue 
 but look at that you know 
 that's what happens 
 okay now hypothetically if i would have known her when she was 3 maybe i could have prevented this maybe i could have prevented my own daughter having to have gone through that 
 okay so there's nonsurgical options okay 
 one is weight loss 
 okay c-pap look at that little babies on c-pap 
 right you think of it for an old person's disease 
 one way nasal valves 
 mandibular advancement devices 
 okay this one and they just bring the jaw forward so you can breathe better right 
 this is what i do okay this is called orthotropics 
 and this is what happens 
 i can create a maxil- maxillary and mandibular advancement i like to get them under the age of 6 we call it kids with lts it sounds like a syndrome right with less than 6 
 number of permanent teeth number of years of age that's when i ideally like to get them 
 i can fix a 10 year-old it's a lot harder 12 it's almost impossible to create this 
 so anyway that's what it looks like 
 again kids as young as 2 years old we're fixing 
 they're very tiny little retainers that go in i do different kinds now that are basically most of them are glued in 
 but you can see what happens 
 this kid didn't even get the tonsils out and this is an orthodontist florida who discovered this independently and we've gotten to be friends now 
 but it's amazing how good it looks and how well and healthy these kids are 
 this is a kid who had her tonsils out twice or her adenoids out twice and then we did this and that's how we fixed her 
 this is how it works real quickly 
 #* it pulls it forward 
 we do it non surgically but that's how it works surgically too 
 the hippocratic oath do no retraction most orthodontics or lack of orthodontics will keep a retrusive face back or make it even worse okay we say treat early and treat protrusively 
 oh there we go i'm done so our next panelist will be up there thank you 
 good job thanks thanks sorry to #* 
 thanks kevin 
 next i'd like to introduce alvin alvin danenberg 
 alvin has been a periodontist for 43 years 
 and he faced some serious personal health challenges in middle age where he was able to address using an ancestral diet and lifestyle 
 and that was part of his inspiration for incorporating ancestral nutrition and lifestyle advice into his practice #* 
 i also wanted to mention that he just released a book called crazy good living and he'll be doing a meet and greet for that book right after this panel if you're interested in that 
 so alvin take it away 
 super so i'm gonna be a little more practical 
 i'm gonna talk about dental plaque and kevin started the subject matter and that is dental plaque is healthy until it's unhealthy 
 so most people think that they need to remove dental plaque as a matter of fact if you go your dentist and your hygienist they're going to make every effort to remove dental plaque and show you how to remove all the dental plaque 
 give you antimicrobial mouthwashes to kill every bacteria and microbe in your mouth and that's theoretically healthy 
 but it's not 
 so dental plaque has a purpose 
 it is a biological film biofilm 
 it is made up of hundreds of microbes 
 some are good some are bad 
 but they are the state of homeostasis or balance 
 and what that means is they serve a purpose 
 if you took out any of the good bacteria in dental plaque the pathogenic bacteria would overgrow 
 if you took out the pathogenic bacteria in dental plaque the good bacteria could change into pathogenic bacteria or allow other pathogenic bacteria that wouldn't even be involved to come in 
 so dental plaque that is healthy dental plaque actually maintains a balanced ph under the gum tissue and around the tooth which is more neutral rather than acid 
 it helps to kill off other pathogenic bacteria that wants to come into the area because it makes its own hydrogen peroxide 
 and in addition it helps remineralize the teeth 
 so your tooth actually is going through a state of remineralisation 24 7 because of the nutrients in the saliva that eventually get into the dental plaque and eventually do what they need to do on the surface of the tooth 
 so if you remove dental plaque you don't have this protection and this is what dental plaque is designed to do to 
 so there are some products on the market that are effective in removing dental plaque all the time 
 so if you use that xylitol in your mouth at #* that you need to do this all the time you will not allow the pellicle which is the earliest form of dental plaque to form on the root of the tooth 
 and you would not have the benefit of healthy dental plaque so what we're gonna happen when healthy dental plaque becomes unhealthy dental plaque 
 now i give you an example 
 there are two studies phenomenal studies 2009 a guy named baumgartner and his research people looked at 10 individuals in switzerland 
 so they were living in switzerland in a remote area and they had they had to live on land they had to hunt and gather their food and they were the only food that were available were were were the foods that were available in the area about 57 hundred years ago 
 so the researchers started off by culturing the bacteria in their tongue the dental plaque and then used different techniques to evaluate the infection of the gum tissue bleeding in the gum tissue as well as spaces between the gum the depth of the spaces 
 so these 10 people had to find their foods that were all unprocessed healthy foods obviously 
 no refined processed carbohydrates no refined sugars no refined flowers and the test or the study lasted for 4 weeks 
 but they could not brush or floss for 4 weeks 
 so the researchers were experimenting to say just how much unhealthy plaque would develop 
 that was the goal of the paper 
 turns out that they had gobs and gobs of dental plaque you might imagine 
 and when they cultured the dental plaque from their tongue and from their from the back here of the tongue and the dental plaque again it had gobs and gobs of bacteria but they weren't virulent 
 and when they tested the bleeding points and the pocket depths around the gum tissue they were st- statistically significantly healthier 
 very interesting 
 there's another gentleman a periodontist in germany johann wölber 
 he is a periodontist a researcher in the university of freiburg 
 and he present- he he he and his staff did a a randomized control trial which is kind of the gold standard in in research with 15 people 
 these 15 people had gum disease the requirement was they had to have gum disease and they had to be eating a standard american diet and you know what that means 
 so here is what he did for the first 2 weeks he had 2 groups 5 were the control group 10 were the experimental group 
 the 5 of the control group and the 10 of the experimental group had to brush their teeth the same as they normally did but they couldn't floss or use little brushes between the teeth the couldn't clean between the teeth 
 the 5 control group ate their normal standard american diet the 10 experimental group had to eat a low carb nutrient dense anti-inflammatory diet basically a paleo slash mediterranean diet 
 they did this for 2 weeks just get acclimated and then at the start of the test the researchers evaluated inflammation in the gum tissue bleeding on probing or pressing on the gum tissue and the depths of the periodontal pockets 
 4 weeks went by as you might imagine there was a tremendous amount of plaque between the teeth around the teeth but quite a bit of plaque between the teeth 
 the experimental group that had a healthy diet that could not clean between the teeth but could brush had 50 percent less bleeding less inflammation and less pocket depth 
 the 5 individuals who were part of the control group that ate their crappy food that did not floss between the teeth but they still brushed had significantly more inflammation lots of plaque deeper pockets and deeper bleed- more bleeding on probing 
 #* basically diet is significantly related to the difference between healthy plaque and unhealthy plaque 
 so how do you get unhealthy plaque well the food that you're eating if it is a standard american diet is having effect in a variety of ways 
 so if you're eating grains you're getting phytic acid that is pulling out minerals in the mouth 
 if you're eating other foods like grains and sugars and they're affecting the gut dysbiosis they're creating a leaky gut and they're creating chronic inflammation that eventually goes to the mouth 
 studies have shown that if you have a leaky gut and chronic inflammation from dysbiosis in the gut you will get dysbiosis in the mouth you will change healthy plaque into unhealthy plaque 
 and what's even more important is when you do have dysbiosis in the gut and you're developing unhealthy plaque 
 just brush brushing and flossing is not necessarily gonna take care of the problem 
 and that unhealthy plaque becomes very pathogenic and it goes from the early stages of gum infection called gingivitis to a much more advanced stage of the disease called periodontitis 
 different bacteria start to proliferate that are resistant to the immune systems' efforts to kill the bacteria 
 so now under the gum tissue because you had this advanced stage of periodontal disease you're developing chronic inflammation 'cause your immune system is constantly trying to fight off this bacteria that's very virulent and very resistant 
 so you're getting leakage from the periodontal pocket into the blood system just like you get leakage from the gut into the blood system 
 and now you have 2 nidus of infection that create chronic disease cardiovascular disease ms rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis you can name a bunch of them 
 and if you only treat the gut dysbiosis which functional medicine does very well but they don't understand the disease in the mouth you won't treat the mouth by treating the dysbiosis in the gut because now you have a new nidus of infection in the mouth that's deep 
 so you have to treat the gut and you have to treat the mouth 
 treat the gut and the mouth get to a healthy diet again nutrient dense anti-inflammatory diet 
 you need to have good exercise you have to have good sleep you have to have good stress control you know the four pillars of health it's what my book is all about 
 th- that was a plug by the way 
 then once you treat these two problems then you can maintain a healthy environment 
 i believe that you if you take care of the dysbiosis in the gut and you're eating a nutrient dense diet you can treat chronic disease 
 end of story and my timer just went off 
 thank you alvin 
 so next i'd like to introduce scott solomons 
 scott got his degree in dentistry at columbia and he's been practicing for 28 years as a general dentist in connecticut 
 he has a background in anthropology from binghamton university 
 and he has experienced substantial benefits from incorporating evolutionary principles into his diet and lifestyle 
 he currently incorporates an ancestral perspective in his practice including diet and lifestyle advice 
 let's welcome scott 
 @applause 
 @applause #* thank you 
 thanks for that intro 
 if you ask my patients they would say he drills and he knows things that's what he does 
 but you're game of thrones fans out there 
 ah so i'm gonna just give you a little background general dentists basically do all the things that these guys don't do 
 sort of a catch-all 
 and so i want to talk about you know how we can incorporate you know this ancestral idea into dentistry as a whole from my perspective 
 i do all clinical stuff so that thing about i drill and know things is is true i i try not to drill but i spend most my time in the clinic treating patients and i just study like a nerd 
 i'm just look at my cheat sheet here 
 so i i generally don't lecture so normally you know it's a one on one kind of a discussion 
 and so you know i can't ask you guys so what brings you into that 
 but i'm gonna just ask a few you know questions it's just kind of you know sororal we're all at so 
 i want you guys to raise your hands if you go to the dentist regularly 
 and it's above average i think 50 percent is the national average it's a little higher actually where i am 
 how many people have ever had a cavity a filling or anything like that 
 most okay and i think it's 91 percent of the population so it's pervasive 
 okay 
 bleeding gums gums disease anything like that going on out there 
 well i would say less than average now what do you think 
 well the statistics would say 
 do i need to do this 
 the statistics would say that 91 percent of the us adult population has what's called gingivitis which means the gum tissue bleeds 
 it doesn't have to bleed when there is a pocket it just bleeds you know 
 can you give me one minute of this 
 so if you were if you were looking in yea- in a mirror you're a woman and you're putting on your makeup or you're guy and shaving and you were doing this really closely and there was blood dripping out of your ear would you be concerned 
 well the gum tissue is as firm as the cuticle around your nail it is as protective or more protective than the cuticle around your nail 
 and it shouldn't bleed 
 and 91 percent so i'm f- feeling a few of you didn't raise your hand but 91 percent has bleeding gums 
 now it's not something to be upset about but you need to recognize it 
 and the reason you have gum disease number one is because your diet 
 there's some other factors but generally diet 
 i think we have a cut above here so i believe you guys 
 okay anybody crooked teeth told your bites off anything like that 
 okay quite a few 
 has anybody ever broken a tooth accident or otherwise 
 okay so that that happens and that's you know not any much you could have done about that 
 any temperature sensitivity 
 @void 
 okay quite a few and sensitivity to put biting hard things pressure 
 okay 
 and then has anybody had their wisdom teeth taken out or have been told 
 about everybody okay 
 so this is normal and one you know of the things that i would love to have done was talk to your parents 
 and i think kevin would 
 had to travel through time a little bit but anyway 
 okay so you know it's it's universal 
 so you know i do lots of normal dentistry i just wanted to let you know that 
 sometimes i've been come to these things since the second one and you know some of the lecturers get up there and and they make it seem like this you know this western medicine approach is terrible 
 well it's not 
 it's quite lovely most of the time 
 you know it's just they don't use this filter that we're you know that we use here 
 so hopefully this is gonna go out on youtube and some of our colleagues can hear this and you know with an open mind and because i just wanted to let you know by the way this is an historic day in dentistry 
 you you don't realize this but this is the first time that three dentists with an evolutionary perspective have ever been on a podium together 
 @applause 
 the problem is we're the monolith not so good not so good 
 so with a little luck maybe they'll be 6 of us here next year but we're hoping for more 
 okay so look at that video out there and you guys you know do your job and and spread the word please 
 let's look at my old cheat sheet here 
 the cake 
 #* 
 okay so you know my approach also because you know i'm talking to people and they don't want to be there they're miserable 
 and you know i ever see try to make everything i can to make them feel at home and comfortable but i really have to boil things down to the simplest possible explanation that can i can't be sitting there citing studies like these guys do they're the brains in the room 
 where 
 so you know i sort of take like the the robb wolf approach though when it comes to all this in that you know if we don't do something in medicine and dentistry there is not gonna be enough money in the world to to fix all this it's it's too expensive 
 so we need to empower you guys and i know i'm preaching to the choir i'll see you guys on the video 
 you know to to take care of yourselves but having said that there's a continuum of different types of patients 
 there's gonna be that patient and there's lots of them they generally skew you know the older crowd where they just want a pill and something quick and they don't wanna change 
 and that's okay that's okay and then there you know all you guys you'll do probably whatever it might take to be healthy and you know you're gonna to embrace change 
 and so this is the challenge i guess that that we have most of us we sort of have cultivated a #* a lot of people come and expect this but i still see a lot of folks who have no idea what they're getting themselves into 
 so you know they can quickly glaze over when i start having this conversation about nutrition and sleep and all that stuff #* what the heck is my dentists talking about sleep for i gotta get out of here 
 and i have to tell you that i make some of my colleagues that i work with there are many partners where i have a multi-specialty practice 
 they get a little nervous they think i've overstepped my bounds but i beg to differ because i feel it's my moral ethical and legal duty to tell you guys all of the options you know that there are out there 
 the fact of the matter is there a 8,760 hours in a year 
 if you're a good patient you gonna come in for 2 hours a year 
 it's not up to me to stop you guys from having your dental problems 
 don't let anybody ever fool you that you know they stopped your problems it's it's gonna be up to you but having said that when you go to the dentist or the doctor you're their boss you pay them okay so they work for you 
 and they better well respect whatever you do okay i just want you guys to know there's nobody you know you should never sit there with a finger waving lecture from your health care practitioner 
 they need to take you as you are and understand you know who you are and what you're willing to do 
 okay coup- couple more things and i'll be done to say something now 
 #* the q&amp;a 
 okay i'll i'll wrap it up so let me just do my little cake analogy that kevin seemed to like so much so one of the things that you know i tell my patients is that the recipe for a happy healthy vibrant human being is pretty simple it's sort of like a cake and don't ask me exactly what's in a cake i really don't know 
 but butter flour sugar leavening something else but a few things 
 so if you put too much flour in a cake it's not gonna really be such a good cake is it so for for a happy healthy vibrant person you need sleep and stress really to you know to be under control 
 there is a certain level of nutrition we need 
 movement sunshine you know nice relationships and friends 
 and if you have too little of any of those things you gonna be in trouble too much of any of those things sometimes can also get you into trouble and i think so over and over and i turn the mic over to stefan 
 thanks 
 thank you very much kevin alvin and scott so now we're gonna transition into the question and answer portion of the panel 
 we're gonna take questions from the audience and i'm gonna ask you to please use this microphone when you're asking your questions 
 we're also gonna have some questions that people left on facebook 
 as well as i'm gonna invoke my moderators privilege and throw in a couple of my own so let's take a question from the audience first 
 go over here because can see been standing there for a while 
 this was a great discussion i cannot wait till this goes on you to the first person send the link to is my dentist 
 you've really liberated me so as small story here mean up until twenty five a crappy diet have 
 in our the fillings for that i third on i've eaten pretty much low carb paleo so going to that to my dentist she's great she cleans my teeth she says wow 
 no bleeding gums are healthy but you aren't flossing i brush the need to floss 
 you need to floss so you just gave me some great ammunition thank you very much 
 to floss right say again i will not say 
 you why i would not say 
 you do not know if you have healthy dental plaque or unhealthy dental plaque and you do not know if your stress level is under control or your sleep pattern is good or you have efficient exercise or is your diet as good as you think is 
 so i would be more proactive and floss but i know in the back of my mind other areas i know that 
 gums no caries at all 
 if i would say you should not fly guess what's gonna happen so i telling you 
 the really need to floss that is i thank you similar answer todd can set to the so again you have we have patients on a continuum so if i do a little graph 
 and you know down in this corner here is the recalcitrant patient does everything wrong and 
 this stuff they're inviting trouble aren't so i would obviously encourage that person to floss then you have you guys on the total opposite end of the spectrum her doing everything right 
 it would be somewhat less critical but as my daughter when she was web would have said hooah were 
 i would make one more addition i brush or floss 
 but yeah yes i brush and floss i will the best thing clean between 
 the brand soft pick by gum g 
 tiny brush 
 remain stockholder and i 
 are it so at this point i'm gonna ask a question from facebook here we had a few questions that were related to the same topic that i think is a really interesting topic 
 and that is what are the best current recommendations for optimizing a child's john face development both prenatally and postnatally 
 and what if the child doesn't want to eat tough or crunchy foods that mechanical forces are one of the things that help 
 proper development of the jaws what if that child does not 
 starve them and 
 the first thing a mom can do and and really this probably starts preconception it's always mom's i mean the guy's got take care a sperm too because person genes but sleep 
 gestational apnea we further gestational hypertension 
 just something called gestational apnea mom who doesn't might have apnea or breathe mouth mouthwashes pregnant maybe putting her baby at risk for inter uterine growth restriction which also shrinks the jaw 
 so that's number one but certainly breastfeeding yet another reason to breastfeed is developing of the powell facial sutro complex it's the same way the brain grows the chromium the tongue 
 and the breast and the nipple and sucking vacuuming it it starts to develop that our ancestors have become ancestors wouldn't survived childhood unless they ancestrally nursed and weaned baby led weaning look at 
 not that's the first thing in terms of you just don't start with gerber let them start eating i mean they can eat 
 percha cannot we can sit up start knowing on things choke baby led weaning google it's amazing 
 so that's know press your every child should see the dentist by one okay press your dentist house the shape of the jaw is we're eating that can be done about 
 most dentists see children this is starting to just come into the lexicon and were people are learning about it so 
 you moved portion i heard you can expand to 
 you may be the person to teach your dentist this 
 both i took chris crest sirs adapt functional medicine course we were first class one or more history 
 i encourage all of you go to chris crushers healthy baby code it's awesome i mean there's a fee for but 
 well worth it and that there was a cool part on there it's been while since babies but 
 i went introduce certain foods just to name the first two egg yolks and liver and when you do this the kids love it 
 goes of seen chris or rob wolf talk about their paleo kids was was a chris's 
 child maybe who couldn't get enough kimchi what one year old 
 which 
 i am of all the changes to the jaw gums and teeth poor diet which ones do you think are the most reversible ancestral 
 i i'm sorry out of all the changes to the jaw gums and teeth from a poor modern diet which ones do you think are the most reversible from an ancestral diet 
 reversible in terms of shape and morphology just roc quick you guys more 
 this has to be done in infancy i mean certainly before the age of six you have got to get in there 
 either one of my residents 
 tom keller he calls it expands aisle foods and they're really just trying to introduce every kid in the try pre industrialized was eating everything that every adult was eating by the age of eleven to twelve months that had have happened 
 so i just introducing solid foods and then introducing expansion orthodontic lee if indicated possible 
 and about the rest of gum disease recession tooth wear tooth loss it's amazing what we can do 
 the thing about 
 in the mouth is and again the analogy to western medicine when body parts fail western medicine rules 
 pretty good 
 so again talking that continuum it's better for didn't happen if i need to replace broken part of a tooth decay part of a tooth i'm using a manmade material i'd rather not have to get to that point because there would be issues but 
 i'm walking across the street and i shatter my femur by car going to the emergency room that put as much titanium in there is 
 a deal with the other issues that my come with having titanium in in me so 
 if you broke off your front tooth or a decayed or something 
 everybody sees might pass judgment maybe care maybe _due_ so the way you would want to treat that would would vary some people wouldn't care pull anything foreign in my mouth 
 and then if you want to say that there are other things we can do we get into canals stuff 
 so again it is a continuum but you look at 
 gum disease gingivitis can be reversed very quickly decay these things are you can we can restore these problems we can restore hard tooth structure back to health we can replace receded gums 
 comes back up into place and then maintenance would be just of course an ancestral type 
 of dental diseases including gum disease and tooth decay are diseases improper diet and chronic 
 question is how to prevent them diet elimination of chronic inflammation and chronic inflammation is not necessarily the source the source 
 the gut so the gut needs to be treated the diet be right be nutrient dense antiinflammatory foods obviously toxic substances there was 
 discussion about glyphosate before glyphosate kills or destroys got bacteria puts holes in the gut lining it destroys the 
 country were eating so much quite say in our conventionally raised vegetables and fruits sadly you know the toxic load becomes the problem 
 problem intermittent may not be such a problem but if you're eating a wheat product six times day you eat breakfast lunch dinner and snack and snack and snack 
 you're going to have dental diseases even if you're brushing and flossing and even thing that three times or every three months for a cleaning 
 invoke my moderators privilege now so my question is how about paleo cookies 
 feel the same way about paleo cookie as if you know you were smoking unfiltered cigarettes and somebody said here this filtered cigarette will be better for you 
 to agreement 
 besides the the cookies and and the paleo breads and of these other substitutes for the food that are obviously unhealthy are very heavy and 
 they 
 wheat products or gluten products but 
 they're probably using 
 are it's on a get back to question from facebook here we had several questions about root canals and about whether they are problematic whether they can contribute to health problems 
 you got a week and a half 
 so yeah again it's a continuum i suppose i out all options for patients it would actually be malpractice if i didn't and the standard of care is a root canal which for those of you know is 
 the nerve inside the root of the tooth and soft tissue in general not just nerve 
 can get infected or exposed and it's trouble so the idea is that that is cleaned out and 
 filling material is put inside the root so that germs care of hide inside the tooth away from your immune system 
 healthy it's called the pulp there's a circulation and out of the tooth and the immune system can function and so germs get 
 your immune system can take care 
 having said that when you look at the majority of the tooth is made of dentin and it's got a whole bunch of tubules 
 microscope it's very spongy looking and that can harbor some bacteria an otherwise healthy person maybe deal with no problem and it checks out okay there's no swelling inflammation the trial 
 right 
 but sometimes get some nasty bugs in there especially the anaerobes which is which 
 and they have a tendency to kick off these lippo polysaccharide endotoxins which can be pretty nasty and 
 keeps talking about that level of inflammation so you can get a lowgrade level of in from inflammation you may not be aware of you may not have any local symptoms around tooth 
 so for my patients we always monitor their overall health but if they come in fairly well compromised 
 we might say yes a root canal can be done but there are other options and the options are nothing which is generally not a great idea 
 having the tooth taken out and the question is should be replaced and how can we replace it that's another discussion 
 my opinion 
 into a full disclosure here i don't dentists anymore i stopped going years ago as an i think it when it was that will let me not the xrays so standard of care now and they 
 have moved around live mouth i grew up so the my sister died of a really aggressive cancer last year i don't do xrays 
 never had a cavity never had braces but about me and ask you guys x raise and a toothpaste recommendation and also what about teeth whitening did our ancestors have nice white pearly teeth 
 or they slightly yellow that biofilm 
 with the toothpaste because not need toothpaste brush 
 so if you want to russian and 
 you brush 
 but what is fine ideal is obviously non fluoridated water we 
 other way whey and filtered water 
 is my opinion 
 also it helps with whitening take difference and 
 some baking soda baking powder baking soda and then brush now baking soda is slightly abrasive but these abrasive ingredient commercial toothpaste it does 
 help neutralize the in the now actually decent great but a decent whitener really wanted to friday white 
 salty by the way you could take and make a paste of baking soda and really scrub it 
 too hard 
 thanks everybody
