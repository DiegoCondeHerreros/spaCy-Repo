thank  O
you  O
generous  O
introduction  O

   
this  O
is  O
showing  O
normal  O
blood  O
pressure  O
for  O
whom  O
americans  B-MISC
and  O
as  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
with  O
age  O
and  O
with  O
the  O
the  O
differences  O
between  O
genders  O
and  O
so  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
female  O
male  O
but  O
anyway  O
this  O
is  O
something  O
that  O
we  O
consider  O
normal  O

   
so  O
i  B-MISC
have  O
sort  O
of  O
a  O
new  O
definition  O
for  O
what  O
a  O
wellness  O
continuum  O
is  O
it's  O
usually  O
predicated  O
on  O
diet  O
nutrition  O
and  O
exercise  O
and  O
physical  O
activity  O

   
we  O
now  O
propose  O
a  O
triangle  O
with  O
sleep  O
and  O
airway  O
hygiene  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
was  O
so  O
glad  O
to  O
hear  O
the  O
talk  O
this  O
morning  O
about  O
ancestral  O
sleep  O
something  O
and  O
very  O
much  O
interested  O
in  O
helping  O
develop  O

   
sorry  O
to  O
interrupt  O
but  O
you  O
don't  O
need  O
the  O
you  O
don't  O
need  O
to  O
hold  O
#*  O

   
i  O
don't  O
need  O
this  O
yeah  O
i've  B-MISC
got  O
i  B-MISC
just  O
like  O
holding  O
a  O
microphone  O

   
so  O
in  O
stress  O
level  O
figures  O
into  O
this  O
continuum  O
somewhere  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
i  I-MISC
don't  O
quite  O
know  O
where  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
it  O
modulates  O
all  O
of  O
them  O

   
diet  O
nutrition  O
is  O
by  O
directional  O
i  B-MISC
mean  O
comfort  O
food  O
right  O
we  O
can  O
alleviate  O
stress  O
with  O
it  O
and  O
we  O
can  O
cause  O
stress  O
and  O
inflammation  O
by  O
over-nutrition  O
wrong  O
nutrition  O
non  O
paleo-nutrition  O

   
same  O
thing  O
with  O
exercise  O
some  O
people  O
do  O
it  O
to  O
relax  O
but  O
it  O
also  O
can  O
if  O
it's  O
not  O
done  O
correctly  O
you  O
can  O
put  O
stresses  O
in  O
the  O
system  O

   
sleep  O
and  O
airway  O
hygiene  O
hygiene  O
does  O
not  O
mean  O
clean  O
hygiene  O
means  O
health  O
okay  O
so  O
dental  O
hygiene  O
clean  O
teeth  O
that's  O
one  O
component  O
of  O
hygiene  O

   
hygiene  O
sleep  O
and  O
airway  O
hygiene  O
is  O
something  O
that  O
we  O
are  O
now  O
teaching  O
dental  O
hygienists  O
to  O
in  O
addition  O
to  O
cleaning  O
teeth  O
we  O
want  O
you  O
to  O
assess  O
airway  O
health  O

   
so  O
anyway  O
normal  O
does  O
not  O
equal  O
healthy  O
alright  O
normal  O
means  O
average  O

   
and  O
and  O
i'm  B-MISC
preaching  O
to  O
the  O
choir  O
obviously  O
you  O
know  O
this  O
but  O
this  O
is  O
gonna  O
be  O
on  O
the  O
internet  B-MISC
and  O
are  O
hoping  O
our  O
dental  O
and  O
medical  O
colleagues  O
will  O
be  O
learning  O
from  O
this  O
as  O
well  O
so  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
stuff  O
i  B-MISC
don't  O
want  O
you  O
think  O
oh  O
he  O
doesn't  O
know  O
we  O
don't  O
know  O
that  O
we  O
know  O
that  O

   
well  O
anyway  O
how  O
about  O
this  O
how  O
about  O
an  O
ancestral  O
norm  O

   
now  O
i'm  B-MISC
i'm  I-MISC
just  O
using  O
blood  O
pressure  O
but  O
it  O
depends  O
on  O
the  O
environment  O
that  O
you're  O
subjected  O
to  O
that  O
determines  O
what  O
is  O
normal  O
and  O
normal  O
equal  O
healthy  O
well  O
1  O
20  O
over  O
80  O
probably  O
is  O
is  O
healthy  O
but  O
it  O
probably  O
should  O
be  O
or  O
genomically  O
we  O
have  O
the  O
potential  O
to  O
have  O
lower  O
blood  O
pressure  O

   
but  O
we're  O
an  O
industrialized  O
society  O
so  O
that's  O
that's  O
as  O
good  O
as  O
it's  O
gonna  O
get  O
for  O
now  O
but  O
maybe  O
when  O
we  O
have  O
our  O
impact  O
on  O
society  O
which  O
we  O
will  O
and  O
we  O
are  O
maybe  O
these  O
10  O
years  O
know  O
they  O
might  O
revise  O
these  O

   
well  O
the  O
same  O
thing  O
exists  O
in  O
orthodontics  O
okay  O

   
the  O
norms  O
that  O
have  O
been  O
established  O
from  O
the  O
nineteen  O
fifties  O
by  O
two  O
white  O
guys  O
who  O
took  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
kids  O
that  O
they  O
thought  O
were  O
good  O
looking  O
and  O
they  O
were  O
powerful  O

   
and  O
these  O
are  O
the  O
norms  O
they're  O
mainly  O
by  O
a  O
guy  O
named  O
steiner  B-MISC
and  O
downs  B-MISC
and  O
these  O
are  O
really  O
the  O
foundation  O
of  O
the  O
norms  O
are  O
used  O
by  O
most  O
orthodontists  O
look  O
at  O
your  O
kids  O
and  O
they're  O
their  O
misdiagnosing  O

   
i'm  O
not  O
indicting  O
the  O
orthodontic  O
profession  O
in  O
fact  O
you  O
will  O
hear  O
later  O
from  O
scott  B-MISC
that  O
western  B-MISC
dentistry  O
is  O
a  O
wonderful  O
thing  O
it  O
does  O
the  O
best  O
that  O
it  O
can  O

   
we  O
want  O
to  O
push  O
it  O
in  O
a  O
direction  O
that  O
can  O
help  O
with  O
be  O
#*  O
all  O
that  O
#*  O
can  O
be  O
by  O
having  O
it  O
be  O
more  O
ancestrally  O
focused  O
well  O
orthodontic  O
norms  O
are  O
leading  O
to  O
kids  O
being  O
treated  O
too  O
late  O
and  O
be  O
treated  O
inappropriately  O

   
if  O
orthodontics  O
was  O
only  O
about  O
cosmetics  O
this  O
really  O
wouldn't  O
be  O
that  O
big  O
a  O
deal  O
i  B-MISC
got  O
beautifully  O
straight  O
teeth  O
but  O
i  B-MISC
had  O
teeth  O
pulled  O
out  O
with  O
a  O
headgear  O
and  O
need  O
jaw  O
surgery  O

   
i'm  O
not  O
overweight  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
snore  O
like  O
a  O
train  O
so  O
it's  O
you  O
know  O
and  O
that  O
can  O
be  O
damaging  O
to  O
end  O
in  O
organ  O
damage  O

   
so  O
what  O
we're  O
saying  O
is  O
what  O
is  O
a  O
new  O
norm  O
that  O
we  O
can  O
use  O
for  O
our  O
little  O
kids  O

   
that's  O
a  O
500  O
year-old  O
palate  O
of  O
one  O
of  O
our  O
museum  O
specimens  O
okay  O
and  O
what  O
i  B-MISC
want  O
you  O
to  O
pay  O
attention  O
to  O
is  O
this  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
back  O
nose  O
the  O
posterior  O
naris  O
this  O
is  O
your  O
nasal  O
septum  O
coming  O
all  O
the  O
way  O
from  O
the  O
front  O
this  O
is  O
where  O
air  O
enters  O
into  O
your  O
throat  O
the  O
pharynx  O
okay  O
it  O
correlates  O
with  O
the  O
with  O
and  O
the  O
depth  O
and  O
the  O
length  O
of  O
the  O
palate  O

   
okay  O
and  O
that's  O
that's  O
you  O
know  O
anyone  O
who  O
wants  O
a  O
reference  O
on  O
anything  O
i'm  B-MISC
not  O
putting  O
them  O
up  O
here  O
but  O
i  B-MISC
have  O
references  O
on  O
everything  O
i  B-MISC
say  O
you  O
can  O
google  O
anything  O
i  B-MISC
say  O
i  B-MISC
am  O
not  O
lying  O
about  O
or  O
exaggerating  O
about  O
anything  O
it's  O
all  O
scientifically  O
medically  O
defensible  O

   
so  O
anyway  O
we're  O
proposing  O
a  O
new  O
norm  O
for  O
orthodontics  O
okay  O

   
and  O
this  O
is  O
pretty  O
much  O
something  O
that  O
we  O
we  O
go  O
back  O
and  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
this  O
was  O
covered  O
in  O
other  O
lectures  O
today  O

   
but  O
you  O
know  O
about  O
2  O
and  O
a  O
half  O
million  O
years  O
ago  O
that's  O
genus  O
homo  B-MISC
when  O
it  O
when  O
it  O
came  O
into  O
being  O

   
40000  O
years  O
that's  O
europeans  B-MISC
cromagnons  I-MISC
and  O
then  O
we  O
say  O
10000  O
it's  O
probably  O
15000  O
when  O
agriculture  O
and  O
domestication  O
of  O
plants  O
started  O
in  O
different  O
places  O
but  O
we  O
use  O
that  O
10  O
to  O
12  O
thousand  O
thing  O
but  O
it's  O
changing  O
all  O
the  O
time  O

   
but  O
that's  O
when  O
we  O
start  O
to  O
see  O
appreciable  O
increases  O
in  O
tooth  O
decay  O

   
now  O
when  O
i  B-MISC
first  O
heard  O
this  O
i  B-MISC
thought  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
lie  O
because  O
i  B-MISC
would  O
have  O
learned  O
about  O
it  O
in  O
dental  O
school  O
huh  O
right  O
this  O
is  O
like  O
paul  B-MISC
simon  I-MISC
when  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
back  O
and  O
all  O
the  O
crap  O
i  B-MISC
learned  O
in  O
high  O
school  O

   
well  O
#*  O
some  O
other  O
things  O
i  B-MISC
didn't  O
learn  O
in  O
dental  O
school  O
was  O
this  O
because  O
i  B-MISC
didn't  O
have  O
to  O
take  O
any  O
anthropology  O
or  O
revolutionary  O
biology  O
is  O
basic  O
science  O
again  O
into  O
school  O
none  O
of  O
us  O
did  O
the  O
physicians  O
don't  O
nobody  O
in  O
healthcare  O
does  O

   
it's  O
not  O
required  O
it  O
should  O
be  O
if  O
it  O
is  O
like  O
according  O
to  O
randy  B-MISC
nessie  I-MISC
it's  O
as  O
if  O
an  O
engineer  O
could  O
be  O
call  O
themselves  O
an  O
engineer  O
without  O
having  O
to  O
take  O
a  O
course  O
in  O
physics  O

   
that's  O
how  O
bad  O
it  O
is  O

   
anyway  O
this  O
is  O
my  O
academy  O
of  O
pediatric  O
dentistry  O
and  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
this  O
is  O
our  O
policy  O
statements  O
and  O
practice  O
guidelines  O
everything  O
and  O
they  O
have  O
this  O
little  O
thing  O
here  O
it's  O
it  O
all  O
has  O
to  O
do  O
with  O
early  O
gum  O
disease  O
early  O
childhood  O
tooth  O
decay  O
early  O
gum  O
disease  O
and  O
tooth  O
decay  O
tartar  O
and  O
that's  O
something  O
that  O
al  B-MISC
is  O
going  O
to  O
talk  O
about  O
later  O
we  O
think  O
of  O
plaque  O
as  O
being  O
intrinsically  O
bad  O

   
he  O
is  O
gonna  O
talk  O
about  O
good  O
plaque  O
okay  O

   
we  O
find  O
15000  O
year-old  O
plaque  O
fossilized  O
it's  O
called  O
calculus  O

   
and  O
there's  O
no  O
gum  O
disease  O
or  O
bone  O
loss  O
or  O
anything  O
associated  O
with  O
it  O
so  O
i  B-MISC
really  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
what  O
he  O
has  O
to  O
say  O

   
nothing  O
about  O
malocclusion  O

   
okay  O
are  O
we  O
we  O
do  O
in  O
our  O
statement  O
now  O
we  O
have  O
a  O
practice  O
guideline  O
for  O
sleep  O
apnea  O

   
which  O
is  O
good  O
and  O
we  O
have  O
all  O
kinds  O
of  O
things  O
about  O
orthodontics  O
but  O
really  O
nothing  O
connecting  O
the  O
2  O
and  O
that's  O
what  O
i  B-MISC
am  O
trying  O
to  O
do  O
with  O
my  O
research  O
and  O
by  O
talking  O
to  O
groups  O
like  O
you  O

   
if  O
we  O
can  O
end  O
childhood  O
obesity  O
why  O
is  O
it  O
that  O
we  O
can't  O
end  O
tooth  O
decay  O

   
okay  O
and  O
you  O
you  O
really  O
just  O
don't  O
hear  O
it  O

   
well  O
because  O
childhood  O
obesity  O
is  O
a  O
nutritionally  O
modulated  O
condition  O
it  O
can  O
be  O
prevented  O

   
michelle  O
obama  I-MISC
she  O
said  O
we  O
can  O
end  O
it  O
in  O
a  O
generation  O
she  O
she's  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
she's  O
technically  O
right  O
it's  O
practically  O
not  O
too  O
realistic  O
but  O
it  O
could  O
be  O
done  O
hypothetically  O
well  O
so  O
too  O
can  O
tooth  O
decay  O
because  O
it  O
involves  O
bacteria  O
but  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
diet  O
modulated  O
disease  O
so  O
we  O
could  O
end  O
it  O
because  O
at  O
one  O
time  O
we  O
used  O
to  O
not  O
really  O
appreciably  O
have  O
it  O

   
there's  O
always  O
been  O
tooth  O
decay  O

   
so  O
it  O
didn't  O
start  O
with  O
agriculture  O
that  O
you  O
can  O
go  O
thou-  O
hundreds  O
of  O
thousands  O
of  O
years  O
and  O
find  O
tooth  O
decay  O
but  O
it  O
wasn't  O
appreciable  O

   
there  O
wasn't  O
much  O

   
okay  O
honey  O
can  O
cause  O
tooth  O
decay  O
and  O
we  O
know  O
our  O
ancestors  O
ate  O
honey  O

   
but  O
what  O
would  O
dentists  O
do  O
when  O
there  O
is  O
no  O
tooth  O
decay  O

   
i  O
have  O
a  O
very  O
busy  O
practice  O
in  O
chicago  B-MISC
and  O
less  O
than  O
10  O
percent  O
of  O
what  O
i  B-MISC
do  O
generating  O
income  O
providing  O
services  O
has  O
anything  O
to  O
do  O
tooth  O
decay  O

   
i'm  O
sort  O
of  O
known  O
as  O
a  O
sugar  O
scoundrel  O

   
i  O
i  I-MISC
tell  O
parents  O
politely  O
look  O
if  O
your  O
if  O
your  O
kid  O
if  O
you're  O
not  O
gonna  O
you  O
know  O
eat  O
the  O
stuff  O
out  O
of  O
the  O
house  O
this  O
might  O
not  O
be  O
the  O
practice  O
for  O
you  O

   
i  O
don't  O
think  O
i've  B-MISC
lost  O
patients  O
before  O
but  O
not  O
for  O
that  O
most  O
parents  O
love  O
it  O
that  O
that  O
i  B-MISC
they  O
were  O
strict  O
such  O
as  O
me  O
and  O
my  O
partner  O
and  O
my  O
my  O
team  O
my  O
staff  O

   
so  O
nutrition  O
counseling  O
again  O
the  O
next  O
2  O
speakers  O
are  O
gonna  O
talk  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O
about  O
that  O
they're  O
very  O
proactive  O
with  O
it  O
i  B-MISC
have  O
a  O
dietetics  O
a  O
nutrition  O
dietetics  O
degree  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
don't  O
do  O
near  O
the  O
degree  O
of  O
counseling  O
that  O
these  O
guys  O
do  O
and  O
#*  O
got  O
some  O
amazing  O
forms  O

   
this  O
is  O
people  O
have  O
been  O
exploring  O
this  O
this  O
was  O
in  O
the  O
journal  B-MISC
of  O
science  B-MISC
in  O
2012  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
focus  O
group  O
an  O
extant  O
focus  O
group  O
at  O
duke  B-MISC
university  I-MISC

   
and  O
i  B-MISC
was  O
on  O
a  O
panel  O
with  O
8  O
anthropologists  O
and  O
8  O
dentists  O
and  O
we  O
came  O
up  O
with  O
this  O
and  O
there's  O
been  O
some  O
articles  O
that  O
look  O
at  O
malocclusion  O
from  O
an  O
evolutionary  O
perspective  O

   
so  O
other  O
people  O
are  O
curious  O
about  O
this  O

   
one  O
of  O
the  O
things  O
that  O
happens  O

   
i  O
don't  O
know  O
why  O
it's  O
the  O
whole  O
space  O
or  O
some-  O
i  B-MISC
don't  O
know  O
if  O
that  O
an  O
av  B-MISC
guy  O
can  O
do  O
it  O

   
because  O
everything  O
is  O
squed  O
over  O

   
well  O
anyway  O
what  O
happens  O
is  O
200  O
thousand  O
250  O
thous-  O
300  O
thousand  O
years  O
as  O
hunter-gatherers  O
right  O

   
our  O
jaws  O
were  O
wider  O
more  O
forward  O
and  O
more  O
less  O
vertical  O

   
okay  O
what  O
happened  O
with  O
agriculture  O
and  O
industry  O
is  O
that  O
the  O
jaws  O
have  O
got  O
narrower  O
more  O
retrusive  O
and  O
vertical  O
they've  O
fallen  O
down  O

   
this  O
is  O
a  O
u-  B-MISC
the  O
universal  B-MISC
phenotypes  O
of  O
a  O
modernization  O

   
if  O
you  O
take  O
an  O
extant  O
hunter-gatherer  O

   
and  O
move  O
them  O
to  O
the  O
big  O
city  B-MISC
in  O
one  O
generation  O
you  O
will  O
see  O
crowding  O
that  O
can't  O
be  O
genetic  O
this  O
is  O
an  O
epigenetic  O
phenomenon  O

   
so  O
this  O
is  O
what  O
happens  O

   
now  O
it  O
has  O
implications  O
for  O
apnea  O
the  O
airway  O
and  O
does  O
everyone  O
know  O
that  O
add  B-MISC
adhd  I-MISC
when  O
you  O
clear  O
up  O
the  O
sleep  O
and  O
improve  O
the  O
breathing  O
usually  O
the  O
symptoms  O
go  O
away  O
from  O
add  B-MISC
adhd  I-MISC
and  O
you  O
can  O
many  O
kids  O
we've  O
taken  O
off  O
ritalin  B-MISC
just  O
by  O
improving  O
their  O
sleep  O
by  O
changing  O
the  O
shape  O
of  O
the  O
jaw  O
some  O
as  O
young  O
as  O
2  O
years  O
old  O

   
okay  O
i'm  B-MISC
doing  O
orthodontics  O
on  O
2  O
year  O
olds  O

   
and  O
the  O
most  O
of  O
them  O
referred  O
from  O
pulmonary  O
specialist  O
ents  B-MISC
pediatricians  O
let's  O
let's  O
let  O
boyd  B-MISC
try  O
nothing  O
else  O
has  O
worked  O

   
we  O
took  O
the  O
tonsils  O
out  O
and  O
the  O
adenoids  O
grew  O
back  O
and  O
the  O
kid's  O
apnea  O
is  O
bad  O
or  O
worse  O
alright  O

   
this  O
is  O
something  O
that  O
is  O
taught  O
in  O
orthodontic  O
programs  O
and  O
orthodontic  O
textbooks  O
that  O
a  O
retrognatic  O
chin  O
is  O
a  O
normal  O
trait  O
and  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
it  O
in  O
utero  O

   
okay  O
and  O
here  O
it  O
is  O
in  O
the  O
textbook  O
but  O
that's  O
just  O
not  O
true  O

   
it's  O
not  O
true  O
there's  O
not  O
a  O
shred  O
of  O
evidence  O
for  O
it  O

   
and  O
what  O
we  O
have  O
found  O
in  O
our  O
samples  O
at  O
the  O
penn  B-MISC
museum  O
is  O
that  O
skulls  O
fetal  O
cadaver  O
skulls  O
before  O
the  O
industrial  B-MISC
revolution  I-MISC
are  O
all  O
bimaxillary  O
protrusive  O
okay  O

   
that  O
implies  O
that  O
they  O
come  O
into  O
the  O
world  O
with  O
the  O
potential  O
the  O
morphology  O
for  O
a  O
healthy  O
airway  O

   
okay  O
the  O
front  O
of  O
the  O
airway  O
is  O
the  O
face  O
the  O
back  O
of  O
the  O
face  O
is  O
the  O
airway  O
we  O
don't  O
say  O
craniofacial  O
anymore  O
we  O
say  O
cranial  O
respiratory  O

   
what  O
happens  O
in  O
the  O
face  O
the  O
palatal-facial  O
sutural  O
complex  O
you  O
have  O
fontanelle  O
soft  O
spots  O
all  O
over  O
the  O
place  O
in  O
your  O
cranial  O
respiratory  O
complex  O

   
so  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
difference  O
and  O
we  O
just  O
superimposed  O
a  O
couple  O
it's  O
not  O
terribly  O
scientific  O
but  O

   
and  O
this  O
width  O
i  B-MISC
told  O
you  O
correlates  O
with  O
the  O
ability  O
to  O
get  O
air  O
through  O
the  O
paranasal  O
sinus  O
complex  O
into  O
the  O
pharynx  O
which  O
to  O
the  O
lungs  O
to  O
the  O
brain  O

   
so  O
there  O
you  O
go  O
you've  O
got  O
a  O
narrow  O
jaw  O
you  O
got  O
a  O
narrow  O
posterior  O
naris  O

   
a  O
wider  O
jaw  O
wider  O
airway  O
less  O
resistance  O

   
treatment  O
of  O
apnea  O
and  O
yes  O
little  O
kids  O
get  O
apnea  O
lots  O
of  O
them  O

   
and  O
little  O
kids  O
right  O
now  O
the  O
treatment  O
of  O
choice  O
is  O
tonsil  O
and  O
adenoid  O
removal  O

   
or  O
they  O
cut  O
a  O
hole  O
in  O
your  O
throat  O
and  O
i've  B-MISC
got  O
mainly  O
syndromic  O
kids  O
that  O
come  O
in  O
with  O
tracheotomies  O
okay  O

   
or  O
maxillomandibular  O
advancement  O
look  O
at  O
that  O
what  O
in  O
medicine  O
do  O
you  O
know  O
has  O
a  O
greater  O
than  O
90  O
percent  O
success  O
rate  O

   
every  O
patient  O
by  O
virtue  O
of  O
the  O
the  O
the  O
name  O
a  O
procedure  O
that  O
will  O
fix  O
it  O
maxillo-  O
maxilla  O
mandibular  O
advancement  O
that  O
means  O
pre-surgically  O
they  O
are  O
maxillomandibular  O
retrusive  O

   
and  O
it  O
starts  O
probably  O
in  O
utero  O
certainly  O
while  O
they're  O
in  O
their  O
baby  O
teeth  O

   
okay  O
this  O
is  O
one  O
of  O
my  O
patients  O
this  O
is  O
her  O
when  O
she  O
was  O
like  O
5  O
and  O
here  O
she  O
was  O
2  O
and  O
a  O
half  O
months  O
ago  O
in  O
intensive  O
care  O
for  O
3  O
days  O
okay  O

   
her  O
dad  O
is  O
a  O
dentist  O
and  O
did  O
not  O
know  O
how  O
to  O
do  O
for  O
her  O
when  O
she  O
was  O
this  O
age  O

   
so  O
that's  O
what  O
had  O
to  O
be  O
done  O

   
he  O
did  O
know  O
what  O
to  O
do  O
for  O
her  O
the  O
little  O
sister  O

   
and  O
she  O
did  O
need  O
jaw  O
surgery  O
and  O
they  O
now  O
look  O
like  O
well  O
their  O
their  O
their  O
airways  O
look  O
remark-  O
#*  O

   
this  O
is  O
her  O
where  O
the  O
adenoids  O
are  O
it's  O
very  O
narrow  O
should  O
be  O
really  O
wide  O
and  O
it's  O
not  O
so  O
she  O
got  O
her  O
tonsils  O
out  O
look  O
how  O
wide  O
it  O
is  O
but  O
look  O
how  O
narrow  O
it  O
is  O
here  O

   
and  O
on  O
3  O
dimensional  O
cone  O
beam  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
it's  O
is  O
really  O
nice  O
up  O
here  O
but  O
it  O
should  O
be  O
all  O
the  O
way  O
down  O
like  O
this  O
okay  O

   
there  O
she  O
is  O
now  O
after  O
her  O
surgery  O

   
cured  O
tmj  B-MISC
anxiety  O
depression  O
apnea  O

   
just  O
really  O
she  O
was  O
tired  O
all  O
the  O
time  O

   
she  O
had  O
a  O
degenerative  O
jaw  O
joint  O
tmj  B-MISC
and  O
it's  O
all  O
fixed  O
okay  O

   
there  O
she  O
is  O
today  O

   
okay  O
now  O
i  B-MISC
know  O
this  O
kid  O
really  O
well  O
that's  O
my  O
daughter  O

   
and  O
you  O
when  O
we  O
drove  O
to  O
saint  B-MISC
louis  I-MISC
to  O
get  O
the  O
surgery  O
you  O
were  O
thought  O
she  O
was  O
going  O
to  O
get  O
a  O
manicure  O
she  O
was  O
so  O
excited  O
she  O
didn't  O
care  O
about  O
the  O
intensive  O
care  O
and  O
being  O
on  O
the  O
table  O
for  O
10  O
hours  O

   
here's  O
another  O
patient  O
that  O
my  O
partner  O
janet  B-MISC
pannaralla  I-MISC
does  O
all  O
the  O
adults  O

   
so  O
she  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
don't  O
treat  O
my  O
own  O
kids  O
so  O
she  O
did  O
all  O
the  O
orthognatic  O
set-up  O
for  O
this  O

   
but  O
we  O
have  O
people  O
flying  O
in  O
from  O
all  O
over  O
the  O
country  O
to  O
get  O
this  O
done  O

   
i  O
don't  O
we  O
also  O
you  O
know  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
last  O
resort  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
rescue  O

   
but  O
look  O
at  O
that  O
you  O
know  O

   
that's  O
what  O
happens  O

   
okay  O
now  O
hypothetically  O
if  O
i  B-MISC
would  O
have  O
known  O
her  O
when  O
she  O
was  O
3  O
maybe  O
i  B-MISC
could  O
have  O
prevented  O
this  O
maybe  O
i  B-MISC
could  O
have  O
prevented  O
my  O
own  O
daughter  O
having  O
to  O
have  O
gone  O
through  O
that  O

   
okay  O
so  O
there's  O
nonsurgical  O
options  O
okay  O

   
one  O
is  O
weight  O
loss  O

   
okay  O
c-pap  B-MISC
look  O
at  O
that  O
little  O
babies  O
on  O
c-pap  B-MISC

   
right  O
you  O
think  O
of  O
it  O
for  O
an  O
old  O
person's  O
disease  O

   
one  O
way  O
nasal  O
valves  O

   
mandibular  O
advancement  O
devices  O

   
okay  O
this  O
one  O
and  O
they  O
just  O
bring  O
the  O
jaw  O
forward  O
so  O
you  O
can  O
breathe  O
better  O
right  O

   
this  O
is  O
what  O
i  B-MISC
do  O
okay  O
this  O
is  O
called  O
orthotropics  O

   
and  O
this  O
is  O
what  O
happens  O

   
i  O
can  O
create  O
a  O
maxil-  O
maxillary  O
and  O
mandibular  O
advancement  O
i  B-MISC
like  O
to  O
get  O
them  O
under  O
the  O
age  O
of  O
6  O
we  O
call  O
it  O
kids  O
with  O
lts  B-MISC
it  O
sounds  O
like  O
a  O
syndrome  O
right  O
with  O
less  O
than  O
6  O

   
number  O
of  O
permanent  O
teeth  O
number  O
of  O
years  O
of  O
age  O
that's  O
when  O
i  B-MISC
ideally  O
like  O
to  O
get  O
them  O

   
i  O
can  O
fix  O
a  O
10  O
year-old  O
it's  O
a  O
lot  O
harder  O
12  O
it's  O
almost  O
impossible  O
to  O
create  O
this  O

   
so  O
anyway  O
that's  O
what  O
it  O
looks  O
like  O

   
again  O
kids  O
as  O
young  O
as  O
2  O
years  O
old  O
we're  O
fixing  O

   
they're  O
very  O
tiny  O
little  O
retainers  O
that  O
go  O
in  O
i  B-MISC
do  O
different  O
kinds  O
now  O
that  O
are  O
basically  O
most  O
of  O
them  O
are  O
glued  O
in  O

   
but  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
what  O
happens  O

   
this  O
kid  O
didn't  O
even  O
get  O
the  O
tonsils  O
out  O
and  O
this  O
is  O
an  O
orthodontist  O
florida  B-MISC
who  O
discovered  O
this  O
independently  O
and  O
we've  O
gotten  O
to  O
be  O
friends  O
now  O

   
but  O
it's  O
amazing  O
how  O
good  O
it  O
looks  O
and  O
how  O
well  O
and  O
healthy  O
these  O
kids  O
are  O

   
this  O
is  O
a  O
kid  O
who  O
had  O
her  O
tonsils  O
out  O
twice  O
or  O
her  O
adenoids  O
out  O
twice  O
and  O
then  O
we  O
did  O
this  O
and  O
that's  O
how  O
we  O
fixed  O
her  O

   
this  O
is  O
how  O
it  O
works  O
real  O
quickly  O

   
#*  O
it  O
pulls  O
it  O
forward  O

   
we  O
do  O
it  O
non  O
surgically  O
but  O
that's  O
how  O
it  O
works  O
surgically  O
too  O

   
the  O
hippocratic  B-MISC
oath  O
do  O
no  O
retraction  O
most  O
orthodontics  O
or  O
lack  O
of  O
orthodontics  O
will  O
keep  O
a  O
retrusive  O
face  O
back  O
or  O
make  O
it  O
even  O
worse  O
okay  O
we  O
say  O
treat  O
early  O
and  O
treat  O
protrusively  O

   
oh  O
there  O
we  O
go  O
i'm  B-MISC
done  O
so  O
our  O
next  O
panelist  O
will  O
be  O
up  O
there  O
thank  O
you  O

   
good  O
job  O
thanks  O
thanks  O
sorry  O
to  O
#*  O

   
thanks  O
kevin  B-MISC

   
next  O
i'd  B-MISC
like  O
to  O
introduce  O
alvin  B-MISC
alvin  I-MISC
danenberg  I-MISC

   
alvin  O
has  O
been  O
a  O
periodontist  O
for  O
43  O
years  O

   
and  O
he  O
faced  O
some  O
serious  O
personal  O
health  O
challenges  O
in  O
middle  O
age  O
where  O
he  O
was  O
able  O
to  O
address  O
using  O
an  O
ancestral  O
diet  O
and  O
lifestyle  O

   
and  O
that  O
was  O
part  O
of  O
his  O
inspiration  O
for  O
incorporating  O
ancestral  O
nutrition  O
and  O
lifestyle  O
advice  O
into  O
his  O
practice  O
#*  O

   
i  O
also  O
wanted  O
to  O
mention  O
that  O
he  O
just  O
released  O
a  O
book  O
called  O
crazy  B-MISC
good  I-MISC
living  I-MISC
and  O
he'll  O
be  O
doing  O
a  O
meet  O
and  O
greet  O
for  O
that  O
book  O
right  O
after  O
this  O
panel  O
if  O
you're  O
interested  O
in  O
that  O

   
so  O
alvin  B-MISC
take  O
it  O
away  O

   
super  O
so  O
i'm  B-MISC
gonna  O
be  O
a  O
little  O
more  O
practical  O

   
i'm  O
gonna  O
talk  O
about  O
dental  O
plaque  O
and  O
kevin  B-MISC
started  O
the  O
subject  O
matter  O
and  O
that  O
is  O
dental  O
plaque  O
is  O
healthy  O
until  O
it's  O
unhealthy  O

   
so  O
most  O
people  O
think  O
that  O
they  O
need  O
to  O
remove  O
dental  O
plaque  O
as  O
a  O
matter  O
of  O
fact  O
if  O
you  O
go  O
your  O
dentist  O
and  O
your  O
hygienist  O
they're  O
going  O
to  O
make  O
every  O
effort  O
to  O
remove  O
dental  O
plaque  O
and  O
show  O
you  O
how  O
to  O
remove  O
all  O
the  O
dental  O
plaque  O

   
give  O
you  O
antimicrobial  O
mouthwashes  O
to  O
kill  O
every  O
bacteria  O
and  O
microbe  O
in  O
your  O
mouth  O
and  O
that's  O
theoretically  O
healthy  O

   
but  O
it's  O
not  O

   
so  O
dental  O
plaque  O
has  O
a  O
purpose  O

   
it  O
is  O
a  O
biological  O
film  O
biofilm  O

   
it  O
is  O
made  O
up  O
of  O
hundreds  O
of  O
microbes  O

   
some  O
are  O
good  O
some  O
are  O
bad  O

   
but  O
they  O
are  O
the  O
state  O
of  O
homeostasis  O
or  O
balance  O

   
and  O
what  O
that  O
means  O
is  O
they  O
serve  O
a  O
purpose  O

   
if  O
you  O
took  O
out  O
any  O
of  O
the  O
good  O
bacteria  O
in  O
dental  O
plaque  O
the  O
pathogenic  O
bacteria  O
would  O
overgrow  O

   
if  O
you  O
took  O
out  O
the  O
pathogenic  O
bacteria  O
in  O
dental  O
plaque  O
the  O
good  O
bacteria  O
could  O
change  O
into  O
pathogenic  O
bacteria  O
or  O
allow  O
other  O
pathogenic  O
bacteria  O
that  O
wouldn't  O
even  O
be  O
involved  O
to  O
come  O
in  O

   
so  O
dental  O
plaque  O
that  O
is  O
healthy  O
dental  O
plaque  O
actually  O
maintains  O
a  O
balanced  O
ph  O
under  O
the  O
gum  O
tissue  O
and  O
around  O
the  O
tooth  O
which  O
is  O
more  O
neutral  O
rather  O
than  O
acid  O

   
it  O
helps  O
to  O
kill  O
off  O
other  O
pathogenic  O
bacteria  O
that  O
wants  O
to  O
come  O
into  O
the  O
area  O
because  O
it  O
makes  O
its  O
own  O
hydrogen  O
peroxide  O

   
and  O
in  O
addition  O
it  O
helps  O
remineralize  O
the  O
teeth  O

   
so  O
your  O
tooth  O
actually  O
is  O
going  O
through  O
a  O
state  O
of  O
remineralisation  O
24  O
7  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
nutrients  O
in  O
the  O
saliva  O
that  O
eventually  O
get  O
into  O
the  O
dental  O
plaque  O
and  O
eventually  O
do  O
what  O
they  O
need  O
to  O
do  O
on  O
the  O
surface  O
of  O
the  O
tooth  O

   
so  O
if  O
you  O
remove  O
dental  O
plaque  O
you  O
don't  O
have  O
this  O
protection  O
and  O
this  O
is  O
what  O
dental  O
plaque  O
is  O
designed  O
to  O
do  O
to  O

   
so  O
there  O
are  O
some  O
products  O
on  O
the  O
market  O
that  O
are  O
effective  O
in  O
removing  O
dental  O
plaque  O
all  O
the  O
time  O

   
so  O
if  O
you  O
use  O
that  O
xylitol  O
in  O
your  O
mouth  O
at  O
#*  O
that  O
you  O
need  O
to  O
do  O
this  O
all  O
the  O
time  O
you  O
will  O
not  O
allow  O
the  O
pellicle  O
which  O
is  O
the  O
earliest  O
form  O
of  O
dental  O
plaque  O
to  O
form  O
on  O
the  O
root  O
of  O
the  O
tooth  O

   
and  O
you  O
would  O
not  O
have  O
the  O
benefit  O
of  O
healthy  O
dental  O
plaque  O
so  O
what  O
we're  O
gonna  O
happen  O
when  O
healthy  O
dental  O
plaque  O
becomes  O
unhealthy  O
dental  O
plaque  O

   
now  O
i  B-MISC
give  O
you  O
an  O
example  O

   
there  O
are  O
two  O
studies  O
phenomenal  O
studies  O
2009  O
a  O
guy  O
named  O
baumgartner  B-MISC
and  O
his  O
research  O
people  O
looked  O
at  O
10  O
individuals  O
in  O
switzerland  B-MISC

   
so  O
they  O
were  O
living  O
in  O
switzerland  B-MISC
in  O
a  O
remote  O
area  O
and  O
they  O
had  O
they  O
had  O
to  O
live  O
on  O
land  O
they  O
had  O
to  O
hunt  O
and  O
gather  O
their  O
food  O
and  O
they  O
were  O
the  O
only  O
food  O
that  O
were  O
available  O
were  O
were  O
were  O
the  O
foods  O
that  O
were  O
available  O
in  O
the  O
area  O
about  O
57  O
hundred  O
years  O
ago  O

   
so  O
the  O
researchers  O
started  O
off  O
by  O
culturing  O
the  O
bacteria  O
in  O
their  O
tongue  O
the  O
dental  O
plaque  O
and  O
then  O
used  O
different  O
techniques  O
to  O
evaluate  O
the  O
infection  O
of  O
the  O
gum  O
tissue  O
bleeding  O
in  O
the  O
gum  O
tissue  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
spaces  O
between  O
the  O
gum  O
the  O
depth  O
of  O
the  O
spaces  O

   
so  O
these  O
10  O
people  O
had  O
to  O
find  O
their  O
foods  O
that  O
were  O
all  O
unprocessed  O
healthy  O
foods  O
obviously  O

   
no  O
refined  O
processed  O
carbohydrates  O
no  O
refined  O
sugars  O
no  O
refined  O
flowers  O
and  O
the  O
test  O
or  O
the  O
study  O
lasted  O
for  O
4  O
weeks  O

   
but  O
they  O
could  O
not  O
brush  O
or  O
floss  O
for  O
4  O
weeks  O

   
so  O
the  O
researchers  O
were  O
experimenting  O
to  O
say  O
just  O
how  O
much  O
unhealthy  O
plaque  O
would  O
develop  O

   
that  O
was  O
the  O
goal  O
of  O
the  O
paper  O

   
turns  O
out  O
that  O
they  O
had  O
gobs  O
and  O
gobs  O
of  O
dental  O
plaque  O
you  O
might  O
imagine  O

   
and  O
when  O
they  O
cultured  O
the  O
dental  O
plaque  O
from  O
their  O
tongue  O
and  O
from  O
their  O
from  O
the  O
back  O
here  O
of  O
the  O
tongue  O
and  O
the  O
dental  O
plaque  O
again  O
it  O
had  O
gobs  O
and  O
gobs  O
of  O
bacteria  O
but  O
they  O
weren't  O
virulent  O

   
and  O
when  O
they  O
tested  O
the  O
bleeding  O
points  O
and  O
the  O
pocket  O
depths  O
around  O
the  O
gum  O
tissue  O
they  O
were  O
st-  O
statistically  O
significantly  O
healthier  O

   
very  O
interesting  O

   
there's  O
another  O
gentleman  O
a  O
periodontist  O
in  O
germany  B-MISC
johann  I-MISC
wölber  I-MISC

   
he  O
is  O
a  O
periodontist  O
a  O
researcher  O
in  O
the  O
university  B-MISC
of  O
freiburg  B-MISC

   
and  O
he  O
present-  O
he  O
he  O
he  O
and  O
his  O
staff  O
did  O
a  O
a  O
randomized  O
control  O
trial  O
which  O
is  O
kind  O
of  O
the  O
gold  O
standard  O
in  O
in  O
research  O
with  O
15  O
people  O

   
these  O
15  O
people  O
had  O
gum  O
disease  O
the  O
requirement  O
was  O
they  O
had  O
to  O
have  O
gum  O
disease  O
and  O
they  O
had  O
to  O
be  O
eating  O
a  O
standard  O
american  B-MISC
diet  O
and  O
you  O
know  O
what  O
that  O
means  O

   
so  O
here  O
is  O
what  O
he  O
did  O
for  O
the  O
first  O
2  O
weeks  O
he  O
had  O
2  O
groups  O
5  O
were  O
the  O
control  O
group  O
10  O
were  O
the  O
experimental  O
group  O

   
the  O
5  O
of  O
the  O
control  O
group  O
and  O
the  O
10  O
of  O
the  O
experimental  O
group  O
had  O
to  O
brush  O
their  O
teeth  O
the  O
same  O
as  O
they  O
normally  O
did  O
but  O
they  O
couldn't  O
floss  O
or  O
use  O
little  O
brushes  O
between  O
the  O
teeth  O
the  O
couldn't  O
clean  O
between  O
the  O
teeth  O

   
the  O
5  O
control  O
group  O
ate  O
their  O
normal  O
standard  O
american  B-MISC
diet  O
the  O
10  O
experimental  O
group  O
had  O
to  O
eat  O
a  O
low  O
carb  O
nutrient  O
dense  O
anti-inflammatory  O
diet  O
basically  O
a  O
paleo  O
slash  O
mediterranean  B-MISC
diet  O

   
they  O
did  O
this  O
for  O
2  O
weeks  O
just  O
get  O
acclimated  O
and  O
then  O
at  O
the  O
start  O
of  O
the  O
test  O
the  O
researchers  O
evaluated  O
inflammation  O
in  O
the  O
gum  O
tissue  O
bleeding  O
on  O
probing  O
or  O
pressing  O
on  O
the  O
gum  O
tissue  O
and  O
the  O
depths  O
of  O
the  O
periodontal  O
pockets  O

   
4  O
weeks  O
went  O
by  O
as  O
you  O
might  O
imagine  O
there  O
was  O
a  O
tremendous  O
amount  O
of  O
plaque  O
between  O
the  O
teeth  O
around  O
the  O
teeth  O
but  O
quite  O
a  O
bit  O
of  O
plaque  O
between  O
the  O
teeth  O

   
the  O
experimental  O
group  O
that  O
had  O
a  O
healthy  O
diet  O
that  O
could  O
not  O
clean  O
between  O
the  O
teeth  O
but  O
could  O
brush  O
had  O
50  O
percent  O
less  O
bleeding  O
less  O
inflammation  O
and  O
less  O
pocket  O
depth  O

   
the  O
5  O
individuals  O
who  O
were  O
part  O
of  O
the  O
control  O
group  O
that  O
ate  O
their  O
crappy  O
food  O
that  O
did  O
not  O
floss  O
between  O
the  O
teeth  O
but  O
they  O
still  O
brushed  O
had  O
significantly  O
more  O
inflammation  O
lots  O
of  O
plaque  O
deeper  O
pockets  O
and  O
deeper  O
bleed-  O
more  O
bleeding  O
on  O
probing  O

   
#*  O
basically  O
diet  O
is  O
significantly  O
related  O
to  O
the  O
difference  O
between  O
healthy  O
plaque  O
and  O
unhealthy  O
plaque  O

   
so  O
how  O
do  O
you  O
get  O
unhealthy  O
plaque  O
well  O
the  O
food  O
that  O
you're  O
eating  O
if  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
standard  O
american  B-MISC
diet  O
is  O
having  O
effect  O
in  O
a  O
variety  O
of  O
ways  O

   
so  O
if  O
you're  O
eating  O
grains  O
you're  O
getting  O
phytic  O
acid  O
that  O
is  O
pulling  O
out  O
minerals  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O

   
if  O
you're  O
eating  O
other  O
foods  O
like  O
grains  O
and  O
sugars  O
and  O
they're  O
affecting  O
the  O
gut  O
dysbiosis  O
they're  O
creating  O
a  O
leaky  O
gut  O
and  O
they're  O
creating  O
chronic  O
inflammation  O
that  O
eventually  O
goes  O
to  O
the  O
mouth  O

   
studies  O
have  O
shown  O
that  O
if  O
you  O
have  O
a  O
leaky  O
gut  O
and  O
chronic  O
inflammation  O
from  O
dysbiosis  O
in  O
the  O
gut  O
you  O
will  O
get  O
dysbiosis  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O
you  O
will  O
change  O
healthy  O
plaque  O
into  O
unhealthy  O
plaque  O

   
and  O
what's  O
even  O
more  O
important  O
is  O
when  O
you  O
do  O
have  O
dysbiosis  O
in  O
the  O
gut  O
and  O
you're  O
developing  O
unhealthy  O
plaque  O

   
just  O
brush  O
brushing  O
and  O
flossing  O
is  O
not  O
necessarily  O
gonna  O
take  O
care  O
of  O
the  O
problem  O

   
and  O
that  O
unhealthy  O
plaque  O
becomes  O
very  O
pathogenic  O
and  O
it  O
goes  O
from  O
the  O
early  O
stages  O
of  O
gum  O
infection  O
called  O
gingivitis  O
to  O
a  O
much  O
more  O
advanced  O
stage  O
of  O
the  O
disease  O
called  O
periodontitis  O

   
different  O
bacteria  O
start  O
to  O
proliferate  O
that  O
are  O
resistant  O
to  O
the  O
immune  O
systems'  O
efforts  O
to  O
kill  O
the  O
bacteria  O

   
so  O
now  O
under  O
the  O
gum  O
tissue  O
because  O
you  O
had  O
this  O
advanced  O
stage  O
of  O
periodontal  O
disease  O
you're  O
developing  O
chronic  O
inflammation  O
'cause  O
your  O
immune  O
system  O
is  O
constantly  O
trying  O
to  O
fight  O
off  O
this  O
bacteria  O
that's  O
very  O
virulent  O
and  O
very  O
resistant  O

   
so  O
you're  O
getting  O
leakage  O
from  O
the  O
periodontal  O
pocket  O
into  O
the  O
blood  O
system  O
just  O
like  O
you  O
get  O
leakage  O
from  O
the  O
gut  O
into  O
the  O
blood  O
system  O

   
and  O
now  O
you  O
have  O
2  O
nidus  O
of  O
infection  O
that  O
create  O
chronic  O
disease  O
cardiovascular  O
disease  O
ms  B-MISC
rheumatoid  O
arthritis  O
psoriasis  O
you  O
can  O
name  O
a  O
bunch  O
of  O
them  O

   
and  O
if  O
you  O
only  O
treat  O
the  O
gut  O
dysbiosis  O
which  O
functional  O
medicine  O
does  O
very  O
well  O
but  O
they  O
don't  O
understand  O
the  O
disease  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O
you  O
won't  O
treat  O
the  O
mouth  O
by  O
treating  O
the  O
dysbiosis  O
in  O
the  O
gut  O
because  O
now  O
you  O
have  O
a  O
new  O
nidus  O
of  O
infection  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O
that's  O
deep  O

   
so  O
you  O
have  O
to  O
treat  O
the  O
gut  O
and  O
you  O
have  O
to  O
treat  O
the  O
mouth  O

   
treat  O
the  O
gut  O
and  O
the  O
mouth  O
get  O
to  O
a  O
healthy  O
diet  O
again  O
nutrient  O
dense  O
anti-inflammatory  O
diet  O

   
you  O
need  O
to  O
have  O
good  O
exercise  O
you  O
have  O
to  O
have  O
good  O
sleep  O
you  O
have  O
to  O
have  O
good  O
stress  O
control  O
you  O
know  O
the  O
four  O
pillars  O
of  O
health  O
it's  O
what  O
my  O
book  O
is  O
all  O
about  O

   
th-  O
that  O
was  O
a  O
plug  O
by  O
the  O
way  O

   
then  O
once  O
you  O
treat  O
these  O
two  O
problems  O
then  O
you  O
can  O
maintain  O
a  O
healthy  O
environment  O

   
i  O
believe  O
that  O
you  O
if  O
you  O
take  O
care  O
of  O
the  O
dysbiosis  O
in  O
the  O
gut  O
and  O
you're  O
eating  O
a  O
nutrient  O
dense  O
diet  O
you  O
can  O
treat  O
chronic  O
disease  O

   
end  O
of  O
story  O
and  O
my  O
timer  O
just  O
went  O
off  O

   
thank  O
you  O
alvin  B-MISC

   
so  O
next  O
i'd  B-MISC
like  O
to  O
introduce  O
scott  B-MISC
solomons  I-MISC

   
scott  O
got  O
his  O
degree  O
in  O
dentistry  O
at  O
columbia  B-MISC
and  O
he's  O
been  O
practicing  O
for  O
28  O
years  O
as  O
a  O
general  O
dentist  O
in  O
connecticut  B-MISC

   
he  O
has  O
a  O
background  O
in  O
anthropology  O
from  O
binghamton  B-MISC
university  I-MISC

   
and  O
he  O
has  O
experienced  O
substantial  O
benefits  O
from  O
incorporating  O
evolutionary  O
principles  O
into  O
his  O
diet  O
and  O
lifestyle  O

   
he  O
currently  O
incorporates  O
an  O
ancestral  O
perspective  O
in  O
his  O
practice  O
including  O
diet  O
and  O
lifestyle  O
advice  O

   
let's  O
welcome  O
scott  B-MISC

   
@applause  O

   
@applause  O
#*  O
thank  O
you  O

   
thanks  O
for  O
that  O
intro  O

   
if  O
you  O
ask  O
my  O
patients  O
they  O
would  O
say  O
he  O
drills  O
and  O
he  O
knows  O
things  O
that's  O
what  O
he  O
does  O

   
but  O
you're  O
game  B-MISC
of  O
thrones  B-MISC
fans  O
out  O
there  O

   
ah  O
so  O
i'm  B-MISC
gonna  O
just  O
give  O
you  O
a  O
little  O
background  O
general  O
dentists  O
basically  O
do  O
all  O
the  O
things  O
that  O
these  O
guys  O
don't  O
do  O

   
sort  O
of  O
a  O
catch-all  O

   
and  O
so  O
i  B-MISC
want  O
to  O
talk  O
about  O
you  O
know  O
how  O
we  O
can  O
incorporate  O
you  O
know  O
this  O
ancestral  O
idea  O
into  O
dentistry  O
as  O
a  O
whole  O
from  O
my  O
perspective  O

   
i  O
do  O
all  O
clinical  O
stuff  O
so  O
that  O
thing  O
about  O
i  B-MISC
drill  O
and  O
know  O
things  O
is  O
is  O
true  O
i  B-MISC
i  I-MISC
try  O
not  O
to  O
drill  O
but  O
i  B-MISC
spend  O
most  O
my  O
time  O
in  O
the  O
clinic  O
treating  O
patients  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
just  O
study  O
like  O
a  O
nerd  O

   
i'm  O
just  O
look  O
at  O
my  O
cheat  O
sheet  O
here  O

   
so  O
i  B-MISC
i  I-MISC
generally  O
don't  O
lecture  O
so  O
normally  O
you  O
know  O
it's  O
a  O
one  O
on  O
one  O
kind  O
of  O
a  O
discussion  O

   
and  O
so  O
you  O
know  O
i  B-MISC
can't  O
ask  O
you  O
guys  O
so  O
what  O
brings  O
you  O
into  O
that  O

   
but  O
i'm  B-MISC
gonna  O
just  O
ask  O
a  O
few  O
you  O
know  O
questions  O
it's  O
just  O
kind  O
of  O
you  O
know  O
sororal  O
we're  O
all  O
at  O
so  O

   
i  O
want  O
you  O
guys  O
to  O
raise  O
your  O
hands  O
if  O
you  O
go  O
to  O
the  O
dentist  O
regularly  O

   
and  O
it's  O
above  O
average  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
50  O
percent  O
is  O
the  O
national  O
average  O
it's  O
a  O
little  O
higher  O
actually  O
where  O
i  B-MISC
am  O

   
how  O
many  O
people  O
have  O
ever  O
had  O
a  O
cavity  O
a  O
filling  O
or  O
anything  O
like  O
that  O

   
most  O
okay  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
it's  O
91  O
percent  O
of  O
the  O
population  O
so  O
it's  O
pervasive  O

   
okay  O

   
bleeding  O
gums  O
gums  O
disease  O
anything  O
like  O
that  O
going  O
on  O
out  O
there  O

   
well  O
i  B-MISC
would  O
say  O
less  O
than  O
average  O
now  O
what  O
do  O
you  O
think  O

   
well  O
the  O
statistics  O
would  O
say  O

   
do  O
i  B-MISC
need  O
to  O
do  O
this  O

   
the  O
statistics  O
would  O
say  O
that  O
91  O
percent  O
of  O
the  O
us  B-MISC
adult  O
population  O
has  O
what's  O
called  O
gingivitis  O
which  O
means  O
the  O
gum  O
tissue  O
bleeds  O

   
it  O
doesn't  O
have  O
to  O
bleed  O
when  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
pocket  O
it  O
just  O
bleeds  O
you  O
know  O

   
can  O
you  O
give  O
me  O
one  O
minute  O
of  O
this  O

   
so  O
if  O
you  O
were  O
if  O
you  O
were  O
looking  O
in  O
yea-  O
in  O
a  O
mirror  O
you're  O
a  O
woman  O
and  O
you're  O
putting  O
on  O
your  O
makeup  O
or  O
you're  O
guy  O
and  O
shaving  O
and  O
you  O
were  O
doing  O
this  O
really  O
closely  O
and  O
there  O
was  O
blood  O
dripping  O
out  O
of  O
your  O
ear  O
would  O
you  O
be  O
concerned  O

   
well  O
the  O
gum  O
tissue  O
is  O
as  O
firm  O
as  O
the  O
cuticle  O
around  O
your  O
nail  O
it  O
is  O
as  O
protective  O
or  O
more  O
protective  O
than  O
the  O
cuticle  O
around  O
your  O
nail  O

   
and  O
it  O
shouldn't  O
bleed  O

   
and  O
91  O
percent  O
so  O
i'm  B-MISC
f-  O
feeling  O
a  O
few  O
of  O
you  O
didn't  O
raise  O
your  O
hand  O
but  O
91  O
percent  O
has  O
bleeding  O
gums  O

   
now  O
it's  O
not  O
something  O
to  O
be  O
upset  O
about  O
but  O
you  O
need  O
to  O
recognize  O
it  O

   
and  O
the  O
reason  O
you  O
have  O
gum  O
disease  O
number  O
one  O
is  O
because  O
your  O
diet  O

   
there's  O
some  O
other  O
factors  O
but  O
generally  O
diet  O

   
i  O
think  O
we  O
have  O
a  O
cut  O
above  O
here  O
so  O
i  B-MISC
believe  O
you  O
guys  O

   
okay  O
anybody  O
crooked  O
teeth  O
told  O
your  O
bites  O
off  O
anything  O
like  O
that  O

   
okay  O
quite  O
a  O
few  O

   
has  O
anybody  O
ever  O
broken  O
a  O
tooth  O
accident  O
or  O
otherwise  O

   
okay  O
so  O
that  O
that  O
happens  O
and  O
that's  O
you  O
know  O
not  O
any  O
much  O
you  O
could  O
have  O
done  O
about  O
that  O

   
any  O
temperature  O
sensitivity  O

   
@void  O

   
okay  O
quite  O
a  O
few  O
and  O
sensitivity  O
to  O
put  O
biting  O
hard  O
things  O
pressure  O

   
okay  O

   
and  O
then  O
has  O
anybody  O
had  O
their  O
wisdom  O
teeth  O
taken  O
out  O
or  O
have  O
been  O
told  O

   
about  O
everybody  O
okay  O

   
so  O
this  O
is  O
normal  O
and  O
one  O
you  O
know  O
of  O
the  O
things  O
that  O
i  B-MISC
would  O
love  O
to  O
have  O
done  O
was  O
talk  O
to  O
your  O
parents  O

   
and  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
kevin  B-MISC
would  O

   
had  O
to  O
travel  O
through  O
time  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O
but  O
anyway  O

   
okay  O
so  O
you  O
know  O
it's  O
it's  O
universal  O

   
so  O
you  O
know  O
i  B-MISC
do  O
lots  O
of  O
normal  O
dentistry  O
i  B-MISC
just  O
wanted  O
to  O
let  O
you  O
know  O
that  O

   
sometimes  O
i've  B-MISC
been  O
come  O
to  O
these  O
things  O
since  O
the  O
second  O
one  O
and  O
you  O
know  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
lecturers  O
get  O
up  O
there  O
and  O
and  O
they  O
make  O
it  O
seem  O
like  O
this  O
you  O
know  O
this  O
western  B-MISC
medicine  O
approach  O
is  O
terrible  O

   
well  O
it's  O
not  O

   
it's  O
quite  O
lovely  O
most  O
of  O
the  O
time  O

   
you  O
know  O
it's  O
just  O
they  O
don't  O
use  O
this  O
filter  O
that  O
we're  O
you  O
know  O
that  O
we  O
use  O
here  O

   
so  O
hopefully  O
this  O
is  O
gonna  O
go  O
out  O
on  O
youtube  B-MISC
and  O
some  O
of  O
our  O
colleagues  O
can  O
hear  O
this  O
and  O
you  O
know  O
with  O
an  O
open  O
mind  O
and  O
because  O
i  B-MISC
just  O
wanted  O
to  O
let  O
you  O
know  O
by  O
the  O
way  O
this  O
is  O
an  O
historic  O
day  O
in  O
dentistry  O

   
you  O
you  O
don't  O
realize  O
this  O
but  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
first  O
time  O
that  O
three  O
dentists  O
with  O
an  O
evolutionary  O
perspective  O
have  O
ever  O
been  O
on  O
a  O
podium  O
together  O

   
@applause  O

   
the  O
problem  O
is  O
we're  O
the  O
monolith  O
not  O
so  O
good  O
not  O
so  O
good  O

   
so  O
with  O
a  O
little  O
luck  O
maybe  O
they'll  O
be  O
6  O
of  O
us  O
here  O
next  O
year  O
but  O
we're  O
hoping  O
for  O
more  O

   
okay  O
so  O
look  O
at  O
that  O
video  O
out  O
there  O
and  O
you  O
guys  O
you  O
know  O
do  O
your  O
job  O
and  O
and  O
spread  O
the  O
word  O
please  O

   
let's  O
look  O
at  O
my  O
old  O
cheat  O
sheet  O
here  O

   
the  O
cake  O

   
#*  O

   
okay  O
so  O
you  O
know  O
my  O
approach  O
also  O
because  O
you  O
know  O
i'm  B-MISC
talking  O
to  O
people  O
and  O
they  O
don't  O
want  O
to  O
be  O
there  O
they're  O
miserable  O

   
and  O
you  O
know  O
i  B-MISC
ever  O
see  O
try  O
to  O
make  O
everything  O
i  B-MISC
can  O
to  O
make  O
them  O
feel  O
at  O
home  O
and  O
comfortable  O
but  O
i  B-MISC
really  O
have  O
to  O
boil  O
things  O
down  O
to  O
the  O
simplest  O
possible  O
explanation  O
that  O
can  O
i  B-MISC
can't  O
be  O
sitting  O
there  O
citing  O
studies  O
like  O
these  O
guys  O
do  O
they're  O
the  O
brains  O
in  O
the  O
room  O

   
where  O

   
so  O
you  O
know  O
i  B-MISC
sort  O
of  O
take  O
like  O
the  O
the  O
robb  B-MISC
wolf  I-MISC
approach  O
though  O
when  O
it  O
comes  O
to  O
all  O
this  O
in  O
that  O
you  O
know  O
if  O
we  O
don't  O
do  O
something  O
in  O
medicine  O
and  O
dentistry  O
there  O
is  O
not  O
gonna  O
be  O
enough  O
money  O
in  O
the  O
world  O
to  O
to  O
fix  O
all  O
this  O
it's  O
it's  O
too  O
expensive  O

   
so  O
we  O
need  O
to  O
empower  O
you  O
guys  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
know  O
i'm  B-MISC
preaching  O
to  O
the  O
choir  O
i'll  B-MISC
see  O
you  O
guys  O
on  O
the  O
video  O

   
you  O
know  O
to  O
to  O
take  O
care  O
of  O
yourselves  O
but  O
having  O
said  O
that  O
there's  O
a  O
continuum  O
of  O
different  O
types  O
of  O
patients  O

   
there's  O
gonna  O
be  O
that  O
patient  O
and  O
there's  O
lots  O
of  O
them  O
they  O
generally  O
skew  O
you  O
know  O
the  O
older  O
crowd  O
where  O
they  O
just  O
want  O
a  O
pill  O
and  O
something  O
quick  O
and  O
they  O
don't  O
wanna  O
change  O

   
and  O
that's  O
okay  O
that's  O
okay  O
and  O
then  O
there  O
you  O
know  O
all  O
you  O
guys  O
you'll  O
do  O
probably  O
whatever  O
it  O
might  O
take  O
to  O
be  O
healthy  O
and  O
you  O
know  O
you're  O
gonna  O
to  O
embrace  O
change  O

   
and  O
so  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
challenge  O
i  B-MISC
guess  O
that  O
that  O
we  O
have  O
most  O
of  O
us  O
we  O
sort  O
of  O
have  O
cultivated  O
a  O
#*  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
people  O
come  O
and  O
expect  O
this  O
but  O
i  B-MISC
still  O
see  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
folks  O
who  O
have  O
no  O
idea  O
what  O
they're  O
getting  O
themselves  O
into  O

   
so  O
you  O
know  O
they  O
can  O
quickly  O
glaze  O
over  O
when  O
i  B-MISC
start  O
having  O
this  O
conversation  O
about  O
nutrition  O
and  O
sleep  O
and  O
all  O
that  O
stuff  O
#*  O
what  O
the  O
heck  O
is  O
my  O
dentists  O
talking  O
about  O
sleep  O
for  O
i  B-MISC
gotta  O
get  O
out  O
of  O
here  O

   
and  O
i  B-MISC
have  O
to  O
tell  O
you  O
that  O
i  B-MISC
make  O
some  O
of  O
my  O
colleagues  O
that  O
i  B-MISC
work  O
with  O
there  O
are  O
many  O
partners  O
where  O
i  B-MISC
have  O
a  O
multi-specialty  O
practice  O

   
they  O
get  O
a  O
little  O
nervous  O
they  O
think  O
i've  B-MISC
overstepped  O
my  O
bounds  O
but  O
i  B-MISC
beg  O
to  O
differ  O
because  O
i  B-MISC
feel  O
it's  O
my  O
moral  O
ethical  O
and  O
legal  O
duty  O
to  O
tell  O
you  O
guys  O
all  O
of  O
the  O
options  O
you  O
know  O
that  O
there  O
are  O
out  O
there  O

   
the  O
fact  O
of  O
the  O
matter  O
is  O
there  O
a  O
8,760  O
hours  O
in  O
a  O
year  O

   
if  O
you're  O
a  O
good  O
patient  O
you  O
gonna  O
come  O
in  O
for  O
2  O
hours  O
a  O
year  O

   
it's  O
not  O
up  O
to  O
me  O
to  O
stop  O
you  O
guys  O
from  O
having  O
your  O
dental  O
problems  O

   
don't  O
let  O
anybody  O
ever  O
fool  O
you  O
that  O
you  O
know  O
they  O
stopped  O
your  O
problems  O
it's  O
it's  O
gonna  O
be  O
up  O
to  O
you  O
but  O
having  O
said  O
that  O
when  O
you  O
go  O
to  O
the  O
dentist  O
or  O
the  O
doctor  O
you're  O
their  O
boss  O
you  O
pay  O
them  O
okay  O
so  O
they  O
work  O
for  O
you  O

   
and  O
they  O
better  O
well  O
respect  O
whatever  O
you  O
do  O
okay  O
i  B-MISC
just  O
want  O
you  O
guys  O
to  O
know  O
there's  O
nobody  O
you  O
know  O
you  O
should  O
never  O
sit  O
there  O
with  O
a  O
finger  O
waving  O
lecture  O
from  O
your  O
health  O
care  O
practitioner  O

   
they  O
need  O
to  O
take  O
you  O
as  O
you  O
are  O
and  O
understand  O
you  O
know  O
who  O
you  O
are  O
and  O
what  O
you're  O
willing  O
to  O
do  O

   
okay  O
coup-  O
couple  O
more  O
things  O
and  O
i'll  B-MISC
be  O
done  O
to  O
say  O
something  O
now  O

   
#*  O
the  O
q&amp;a  B-MISC

   
okay  O
i'll  B-MISC
i'll  I-MISC
wrap  O
it  O
up  O
so  O
let  O
me  O
just  O
do  O
my  O
little  O
cake  O
analogy  O
that  O
kevin  B-MISC
seemed  O
to  O
like  O
so  O
much  O
so  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
things  O
that  O
you  O
know  O
i  B-MISC
tell  O
my  O
patients  O
is  O
that  O
the  O
recipe  O
for  O
a  O
happy  O
healthy  O
vibrant  O
human  O
being  O
is  O
pretty  O
simple  O
it's  O
sort  O
of  O
like  O
a  O
cake  O
and  O
don't  O
ask  O
me  O
exactly  O
what's  O
in  O
a  O
cake  O
i  B-MISC
really  O
don't  O
know  O

   
but  O
butter  O
flour  O
sugar  O
leavening  O
something  O
else  O
but  O
a  O
few  O
things  O

   
so  O
if  O
you  O
put  O
too  O
much  O
flour  O
in  O
a  O
cake  O
it's  O
not  O
gonna  O
really  O
be  O
such  O
a  O
good  O
cake  O
is  O
it  O
so  O
for  O
for  O
a  O
happy  O
healthy  O
vibrant  O
person  O
you  O
need  O
sleep  O
and  O
stress  O
really  O
to  O
you  O
know  O
to  O
be  O
under  O
control  O

   
there  O
is  O
a  O
certain  O
level  O
of  O
nutrition  O
we  O
need  O

   
movement  O
sunshine  O
you  O
know  O
nice  O
relationships  O
and  O
friends  O

   
and  O
if  O
you  O
have  O
too  O
little  O
of  O
any  O
of  O
those  O
things  O
you  O
gonna  O
be  O
in  O
trouble  O
too  O
much  O
of  O
any  O
of  O
those  O
things  O
sometimes  O
can  O
also  O
get  O
you  O
into  O
trouble  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
so  O
over  O
and  O
over  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
turn  O
the  O
mic  O
over  O
to  O
stefan  B-MISC

we're  O
gonna  O
transition  O
into  O
the  O
question  O
and  O
answer  O
portion  O
of  O
the  O
panel  O

   
we're  O
gonna  O
take  O
questions  O
from  O
the  O
audience  O
and  O
i'm  B-MISC
gonna  O
ask  O
you  O

invoke  O
my  O
moderators  O
privilege  O
and  O
throw  O
in  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
my  O
own  O

over  O
here  O

while  O

was  O
a  O
great  O
discussion  O
i  B-MISC
cannot  O
wait  O
till  O
this  O
goes  O
on  O

are  O
healthy  O
but  O
you  O
aren't  O
flossing  O
i  B-MISC
brush  O
the  O
need  O
to  O
floss  O

   
you  O
need  O
to  O
floss  O
so  O
you  O
just  O
gave  O
me  O
some  O
great  O
ammunition  O
thank  O
you  O
very  O
much  O

   
to  O
floss  O
right  O
say  O
again  O
i  B-MISC
will  O
not  O
say  O

   
you  O
why  O
i  B-MISC
would  O
not  O
say  O

   
you  O
do  O
not  O
know  O
if  O
you  O
have  O
healthy  O
dental  O
plaque  O
or  O
unhealthy  O
dental  O
plaque  O
and  O
you  O
do  O
not  O
know  O
if  O
your  O
stress  O
level  O
is  O
under  O
control  O
or  O
your  O
sleep  O
pattern  O
is  O
good  O
or  O
you  O
have  O
efficient  O
exercise  O
or  O
is  O
your  O
diet  O
as  O
good  O
as  O
you  O
think  O
is  O

   
so  O
i  B-MISC
would  O
be  O
more  O
proactive  O
and  O
floss  O
but  O
i  B-MISC
know  O
in  O
the  O
back  O
of  O
my  O
mind  O
other  O
areas  O
i  B-MISC
know  O
that  O

   
gums  O
no  O
caries  O
at  O
all  O

   
if  O
i  B-MISC
would  O
say  O
you  O
should  O
not  O
fly  O
guess  O
what's  O
gonna  O
happen  O
so  O
i  B-MISC
telling  O
you  O

   
the  O
really  O
need  O
to  O
floss  O
that  O
is  O
i  B-MISC
thank  O
you  O
similar  O
answer  O
todd  B-MISC
can  O
set  O
to  O
the  O
so  O
again  O
you  O
have  O
we  O
have  O
patients  O
on  O
a  O
continuum  O
so  O
if  O
i  B-MISC
do  O
a  O
little  O
graph  O

   
and  O
you  O
know  O
down  O
in  O
this  O
corner  O
here  O
is  O
the  O
recalcitrant  O
patient  O
does  O
everything  O
wrong  O
and  O

   
this  O
stuff  O
they're  O
inviting  O
trouble  O
aren't  O
so  O
i  B-MISC
would  O
obviously  O
encourage  O
that  O
person  O
to  O
floss  O
then  O
you  O
have  O
you  O
guys  O
on  O
the  O
total  O
opposite  O
end  O
of  O
the  O
spectrum  O
her  O
doing  O
everything  O
right  O

   
it  O
would  O
be  O
somewhat  O
less  O
critical  O
but  O
as  O
my  O
daughter  O
when  O
she  O
was  O
web  O
would  O
have  O
said  O
hooah  O
were  O

   
i  O
would  O
make  O
one  O
more  O
addition  O
i  B-MISC
brush  O
or  O
floss  O

   
but  O
yeah  O
yes  O
i  B-MISC
brush  O
and  O
floss  O
i  B-MISC
will  O
the  O
best  O
thing  O
clean  O
between  O

   
the  O
brand  O
soft  O
pick  O
by  O
gum  O
g  O

   
tiny  O
brush  O

   
remain  O
stockholder  O
and  O
i  B-MISC

   
are  O
it  O
so  O
at  O
this  O
point  O
i'm  B-MISC
gonna  O
ask  O
a  O
question  O
from  O
facebook  B-MISC
here  O
we  O
had  O
a  O
few  O
questions  O
that  O
were  O
related  O
to  O
the  O
same  O
topic  O
that  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
is  O
a  O
really  O
interesting  O
topic  O

   
and  O
that  O
is  O
what  O
are  O
the  O
best  O
current  O
recommendations  O
for  O
optimizing  O
a  O
child's  O
john  B-MISC
face  O
development  O
both  O
prenatally  O
and  O
postnatally  O

   
and  O
what  O
if  O
the  O
child  O
doesn't  O
want  O
to  O
eat  O
tough  O
or  O
crunchy  O
foods  O
that  O
mechanical  O
forces  O
are  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
things  O
that  O
help  O

   
proper  O
development  O
of  O
the  O
jaws  O
what  O
if  O
that  O
child  O
does  O
not  O

   
starve  O
them  O
and  O

   
the  O
first  O
thing  O
a  O
mom  O
can  O
do  O
and  O
and  O
really  O
this  O
probably  O
starts  O
preconception  O
it's  O
always  O
mom's  O
i  B-MISC
mean  O
the  O
guy's  O
got  O
take  O
care  O
a  O
sperm  O
too  O
because  O
person  O
genes  O
but  O
sleep  O

   
gestational  O
apnea  O
we  O
further  O
gestational  O
hypertension  O

   
just  O
something  O
called  O
gestational  O
apnea  O
mom  O
who  O
doesn't  O
might  O
have  O
apnea  O
or  O
breathe  O
mouth  O
mouthwashes  O
pregnant  O
maybe  O
putting  O
her  O
baby  O
at  O
risk  O
for  O
inter  O
uterine  O
growth  O
restriction  O
which  O
also  O
shrinks  O
the  O
jaw  O

   
so  O
that's  O
number  O
one  O
but  O
certainly  O
breastfeeding  O
yet  O
another  O
reason  O
to  O
breastfeed  O
is  O
developing  O
of  O
the  O
powell  O
facial  O
sutro  B-MISC
complex  O
it's  O
the  O
same  O
way  O
the  O
brain  O
grows  O
the  O
chromium  B-MISC
the  O
tongue  O

   
and  O
the  O
breast  O
and  O
the  O
nipple  O
and  O
sucking  O
vacuuming  O
it  O
it  O
starts  O
to  O
develop  O
that  O
our  O
ancestors  O
have  O
become  O
ancestors  O
wouldn't  O
survived  O
childhood  O
unless  O
they  O
ancestrally  O
nursed  O
and  O
weaned  O
baby  O
led  O
weaning  O
look  O
at  O

   
not  O
that's  O
the  O
first  O
thing  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
you  O
just  O
don't  O
start  O
with  O
gerber  B-MISC
let  O
them  O
start  O
eating  O
i  B-MISC
mean  O
they  O
can  O
eat  O

   
percha  O
cannot  O
we  O
can  O
sit  O
up  O
start  O
knowing  O
on  O
things  O
choke  O
baby  O
led  O
weaning  O
google  O
it's  O
amazing  O

   
so  O
that's  O
know  O
press  O
your  O
every  O
child  O
should  O
see  O
the  O
dentist  O
by  O
one  O
okay  O
press  O
your  O
dentist  O
house  O
the  O
shape  O
of  O
the  O
jaw  O
is  O
we're  O
eating  O
that  O
can  O
be  O
done  O
about  O

   
most  O
dentists  O
see  O
children  O
this  O
is  O
starting  O
to  O
just  O
come  O
into  O
the  O
lexicon  O
and  O
were  O
people  O
are  O
learning  O
about  O
it  O
so  O

   
you  O
moved  O
portion  O
i  B-MISC
heard  O
you  O
can  O
expand  O
to  O

   
you  O
may  O
be  O
the  O
person  O
to  O
teach  O
your  O

i  B-MISC

there's  O
a  O

well  O
worth  O
it  O
and  O
that  O
there  O
was  O
a  O
cool  O
part  O
on  O
there  O
it's  O
been  O
while  O
since  O
babies  O
but  O

   
i  O
went  O
introduce  O
certain  O

just  O
to  O
name  O
the  O
first  O
two  O
egg  O

and  O
when  O
you  O

it  O

   
goes  O

what  O
one  O

which  O

   
i  O
am  O
of  O
all  O
the  O
changes  O
to  O
the  O

which  O

do  O
you  O

are  O
the  O
most  O
reversible  O
ancestral  O

   
i  O
i'm  I-MISC
sorry  O
out  O
of  O
all  O
the  O
changes  O
to  O
the  O
jaw  O
gums  O
and  O
teeth  O
from  O
a  O
poor  O
modern  O
diet  O
which  O
ones  O
do  O
you  O
think  O
are  O
the  O
most  O
reversible  O
from  O
an  O
ancestral  O
diet  O

   
reversible  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
shape  O
and  O
morphology  O
just  O
roc  B-MISC
quick  O
you  O
guys  O
more  O

   
this  O
has  O
to  O
be  O
done  O
in  O
infancy  O
i  B-MISC
mean  O
certainly  O
before  O
the  O
age  O
of  O
six  O
you  O
have  O
got  O
to  O
get  O
in  O
there  O

   
either  O
one  O
of  O
my  O
residents  O

   
tom  O
keller  I-MISC
he  O
calls  O
it  O
expands  O
aisle  O
foods  O
and  O
they're  O
really  O
just  O
trying  O
to  O
introduce  O
every  O
kid  O
in  O
the  O
try  O
pre  O
industrialized  O
was  O
eating  O
everything  O
that  O
every  O
adult  O
was  O
eating  O
by  O
the  O
age  O
of  O
eleven  O
to  O
twelve  O
months  O
that  O
had  O
have  O
happened  O

   
so  O
i  B-MISC
just  O
introducing  O
solid  O
foods  O
and  O
then  O
introducing  O
expansion  O
orthodontic  O
lee  O
if  O
indicated  O
possible  O

   
and  O
about  O
the  O
rest  O
of  O
gum  O
disease  O
recession  O
tooth  O
wear  O
tooth  O
loss  O
it's  O
amazing  O
what  O
we  O
can  O
do  O

   
the  O
thing  O
about  O

   
in  O
the  O
mouth  O
is  O
and  O
again  O
the  O
analogy  O
to  O
western  B-MISC
medicine  O
when  O
body  O
parts  O
fail  O
western  B-MISC
medicine  O
rules  O

   
pretty  O
good  O

   
so  O
again  O
talking  O
that  O
continuum  O
it's  O
better  O
for  O
didn't  O
happen  O
if  O
i  B-MISC
need  O
to  O
replace  O
broken  O
part  O
of  O
a  O
tooth  O
decay  O
part  O
of  O
a  O
tooth  O
i'm  B-MISC
using  O
a  O
manmade  O
material  O
i'd  B-MISC
rather  O
not  O
have  O
to  O
get  O
to  O
that  O
point  O
because  O
there  O
would  O
be  O
issues  O
but  O

   
i'm  O
walking  O
across  O
the  O
street  B-MISC
and  O
i  B-MISC
shatter  O
my  O
femur  O
by  O
car  O
going  O
to  O
the  O
emergency  O
room  O
that  O
put  O
as  O
much  O
titanium  O
in  O
there  O
is  O

   
a  O
deal  O
with  O
the  O
other  O
issues  O
that  O
my  O
come  O
with  O
having  O
titanium  O
in  O
in  O
me  O
so  O

   
if  O
you  O
broke  O
off  O
your  O
front  O
tooth  O
or  O
a  O
decayed  O
or  O
something  O

   
everybody  O
sees  O
might  O
pass  O
judgment  O
maybe  O
care  O
maybe  O
_due_  O
so  O
the  O
way  O
you  O
would  O
want  O
to  O
treat  O
that  O
would  O
would  O
vary  O
some  O
people  O
wouldn't  O
care  O
pull  O
anything  O
foreign  O
in  O
my  O
mouth  O

   
and  O
then  O
if  O
you  O
want  O
to  O
say  O
that  O
there  O
are  O
other  O
things  O
we  O
can  O
do  O
we  O
get  O
into  O
canals  O
stuff  O

   
so  O
again  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
continuum  O
but  O
you  O
look  O
at  O

   
gum  O
disease  O
gingivitis  O
can  O
be  O
reversed  O
very  O
quickly  O
decay  O
these  O
things  O
are  O
you  O
can  O
we  O
can  O
restore  O
these  O
problems  O
we  O
can  O
restore  O
hard  O
tooth  O
structure  O
back  O
to  O
health  O
we  O
can  O
replace  O
receded  O
gums  O

   
comes  O
back  O
up  O
into  O
place  O
and  O
then  O
maintenance  O
would  O
be  O
just  O
of  O
course  O
an  O
ancestral  O
type  O

   
of  O
dental  O
diseases  O
including  O
gum  O
disease  O
and  O
tooth  O
decay  O
are  O
diseases  O
improper  O
diet  O
and  O
chronic  O

   
question  O
is  O
how  O
to  O
prevent  O
them  O
diet  O
elimination  O
of  O
chronic  O
inflammation  O
and  O
chronic  O
inflammation  O
is  O
not  O
necessarily  O
the  O
source  O
the  O
source  O

   
the  O
gut  O
so  O
the  O
gut  O
needs  O
to  O
be  O
treated  O
the  O
diet  O
be  O
right  O
be  O
nutrient  O
dense  O
antiinflammatory  O
foods  O
obviously  O
toxic  O
substances  O
there  O
was  O

   
discussion  O
about  O
glyphosate  O
before  O
glyphosate  O
kills  O
or  O
destroys  O
got  O
bacteria  O
puts  O
holes  O
in  O
the  O
gut  O
lining  O
it  O
destroys  O
the  O

   
country  O
were  O
eating  O
so  O
much  O
quite  O
say  O
in  O
our  O
conventionally  O
raised  O
vegetables  O
and  O
fruits  O
sadly  O
you  O
know  O
the  O
toxic  O
load  O
becomes  O
the  O
problem  O

   
problem  O
intermittent  O
may  O
not  O
be  O
such  O
a  O
problem  O
but  O
if  O
you're  O
eating  O
a  O
wheat  O
product  O
six  O
times  O
day  O
you  O
eat  O
breakfast  O
lunch  O
dinner  O
and  O
snack  O
and  O
snack  O
and  O
snack  O

   
you're  O
going  O
to  O
have  O
dental  O
diseases  O
even  O
if  O
you're  O
brushing  O
and  O
flossing  O
and  O
even  O
thing  O
that  O
three  O
times  O
or  O
every  O
three  O
months  O
for  O
a  O
cleaning  O

   
invoke  O
my  O
moderators  O
privilege  O
now  O
so  O
my  O
question  O
is  O
how  O
about  O
paleo  O
cookies  O

   
feel  O
the  O
same  O
way  O
about  O
paleo  O
cookie  O
as  O
if  O
you  O
know  O
you  O
were  O
smoking  O
unfiltered  O
cigarettes  O
and  O
somebody  O
said  O
here  O
this  O
filtered  O
cigarette  O
will  O
be  O
better  O
for  O
you  O

   
to  O
agreement  O

   
besides  O
the  O
the  O
cookies  O
and  O
and  O
the  O
paleo  O
breads  O
and  O
of  O
these  O
other  O
substitutes  O
for  O
the  O
food  O
that  O
are  O
obviously  O
unhealthy  O
are  O
very  O
heavy  O
and  O

   
they  O

   
wheat  O
products  O
or  O
gluten  O
products  O
but  O

   
they're  O
probably  O
using  O

   
are  O
it's  O
on  O
a  O
get  O
back  O
to  O
question  O
from  O
facebook  B-MISC
here  O
we  O
had  O
several  O
questions  O
about  O
root  O
canals  O
and  O
about  O
whether  O
they  O
are  O
problematic  O
whether  O
they  O
can  O
contribute  O
to  O
health  O
problems  O

   
you  O
got  O
a  O
week  O
and  O
a  O
half  O

   
so  O
yeah  O
again  O
it's  O
a  O
continuum  O
i  B-MISC
suppose  O
i  B-MISC
out  O
all  O
options  O
for  O
patients  O
it  O
would  O
actually  O
be  O
malpractice  O
if  O
i  B-MISC
didn't  O
and  O
the  O
standard  O
of  O
care  O
is  O
a  O
root  O
canal  O
which  O
for  O
those  O
of  O
you  O
know  O
is  O

   
the  O
nerve  O
inside  O
the  O
root  O
of  O
the  O
tooth  O
and  O
soft  O
tissue  O
in  O
general  O
not  O
just  O
nerve  O

   
can  O
get  O
infected  O
or  O
exposed  O
and  O
it's  O
trouble  O
so  O
the  O
idea  O
is  O
that  O
that  O
is  O
cleaned  O
out  O
and  O

   
filling  O
material  O
is  O
put  O
inside  O
the  O
root  O
so  O
that  O
germs  O
care  O
of  O
hide  O
inside  O
the  O
tooth  O
away  O
from  O
your  O
immune  O
system  O

   
healthy  O
it's  O
called  O
the  O
pulp  O
there's  O
a  O
circulation  O
and  O
out  O
of  O
the  O
tooth  O
and  O
the  O
immune  O
system  O
can  O
function  O
and  O
so  O
germs  O
get  O

   
your  O
immune  O
system  O
can  O
take  O
care  O

   
having  O
said  O
that  O
when  O
you  O
look  O
at  O
the  O
majority  O
of  O
the  O
tooth  O
is  O
made  O
of  O
dentin  O
and  O
it's  O
got  O
a  O
whole  O
bunch  O
of  O
tubules  O

   
microscope  O
it's  O
very  O
spongy  O
looking  O
and  O
that  O
can  O
harbor  B-MISC
some  O
bacteria  O
an  O
otherwise  O
healthy  O
person  O
maybe  O
deal  O
with  O
no  O
problem  O
and  O
it  O
checks  O
out  O
okay  O
there's  O
no  O
swelling  O
inflammation  O
the  O
trial  O

   
right  O

   
but  O
sometimes  O
get  O
some  O
nasty  O
bugs  O
in  O
there  O
especially  O
the  O
anaerobes  O
which  O
is  O
which  O

   
and  O
they  O
have  O
a  O
tendency  O
to  O
kick  O
off  O
these  O
lippo  B-MISC
polysaccharide  O
endotoxins  O
which  O
can  O
be  O
pretty  O
nasty  O
and  O

   
keeps  O
talking  O
about  O
that  O
level  O
of  O
inflammation  O
so  O
you  O
can  O
get  O
a  O
lowgrade  O
level  O
of  O
in  O
from  O
inflammation  O
you  O
may  O
not  O
be  O
aware  O
of  O
you  O
may  O
not  O
have  O
any  O
local  O
symptoms  O
around  O
tooth  O

   
so  O
for  O
my  O
patients  O
we  O
always  O
monitor  O
their  O
overall  O
health  O
but  O
if  O
they  O
come  O
in  O
fairly  O
well  O
compromised  O

   
we  O
might  O
say  O
yes  O
a  O
root  O
canal  O
can  O
be  O
done  O
but  O
there  O
are  O
other  O
options  O
and  O
the  O
options  O
are  O
nothing  O
which  O
is  O
generally  O
not  O
a  O
great  O
idea  O

   
having  O
the  O
tooth  O
taken  O
out  O
and  O
the  O
question  O
is  O
should  O
be  O
replaced  O
and  O
how  O
can  O
we  O
replace  O
it  O
that's  O
another  O
discussion  O

   
my  O
opinion  O

   
into  O
a  O
full  O
disclosure  O
here  O
i  B-MISC
don't  O
dentists  O
anymore  O
i  B-MISC
stopped  O
going  O
years  O
ago  O
as  O
an  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
it  O
when  O
it  O
was  O
that  O
will  O
let  O
me  O
not  O
the  O
xrays  O
so  O
standard  O
of  O
care  O
now  O
and  O
they  O

   
have  O
moved  O
around  O
live  O
mouth  O
i  B-MISC
grew  O
up  O
so  O
the  O
my  O
sister  O
died  O
of  O
a  O
really  O
aggressive  O
cancer  O
last  O
year  O
i  B-MISC
don't  O
do  O
xrays  O

   
never  O
had  O
a  O
cavity  O
never  O
had  O
braces  O
but  O
about  O
me  O
and  O
ask  O
you  O
guys  O
x  B-MISC
raise  O
and  O
a  O
toothpaste  O
recommendation  O
and  O
also  O
what  O
about  O
teeth  O
whitening  O
did  O
our  O
ancestors  O
have  O
nice  O
white  O
pearly  O
teeth  O

   
or  O
they  O
slightly  O
yellow  O
that  O
biofilm  O

   
with  O
the  O
toothpaste  O
because  O
not  O
need  O
toothpaste  O
brush  O

   
so  O
if  O
you  O
want  O
to  O
russian  B-MISC
and  O

   
you  O
brush  O

   
but  O
what  O
is  O
fine  O
ideal  O
is  O
obviously  O
non  O
fluoridated  O
water  O
we  O

   
other  O
way  O
whey  O
and  O
filtered  O
water  O

   
is  O
my  O
opinion  O

   
also  O
it  O
helps  O
with  O
whitening  O
take  O
difference  O
and  O

   
some  O
baking  O
soda  O
baking  O
powder  O
baking  O
soda  O
and  O
then  O
brush  O
now  O
baking  O
soda  O
is  O
slightly  O
abrasive  O
but  O
these  O
abrasive  O
ingredient  O
commercial  O
toothpaste  O
it  O
does  O

   
help  O
neutralize  O
the  O
in  O
the  O
now  O
actually  O
decent  O
great  O
but  O
a  O
decent  O
whitener  O
really  O
wanted  O
to  O
friday  B-MISC
white  O

   
salty  O
by  O
the  O
way  O
you  O
could  O
take  O
and  O
make  O
a  O
paste  O
of  O
baking  O
soda  O
and  O
really  O
scrub  O
it  O

   
too  O
hard  O

   
thanks  O
everybody  O
