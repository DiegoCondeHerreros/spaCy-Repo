 @applause 
 good afternoon 
 it's a pleasure to be here 
 i wanna thank the co-directors of the course and the dental school for the invitation to come and speak to you about a topic that i actually feel quite passionate about 
 and i wanna also thank doctor polverini for the wonderful dinner last night and the discussions 
 what i would like to do is by way of overview just talk to you a little bit about genetics and how i think genetics has influenced my research and also i think is influencing the field specifically the translation of clinical research in the clinical practice 
 to do that i'm gonna overview a little perspective genetics 
 i'm gonna talk a little bit about enamel and dent- defects and really from the clinical perspective as i see it now and going forward 
 jim simmer is gonna talk more about mechanistic biology of these defects 
 then i wanna talk a little bit about have a think session about clinical implications and i'm talking about the future of how we're gonna integrate genetics in the clinical care 
 and to do that i'm gonna review a little bit of the different types of genetic diseases just very broadly and how genetic factors contribute to disease 'cause i think that understanding is really important to understand or or trying to see where the future is going 
 now with that said nowadays i think it's not a rush statement to say the etiologic basis of most human diseases can be defined in terms of or due to gene-gene and or gene-environment interactions 
 and in fact this whole concept which was really a little more radical at the time in the late 80s early 90s when the human genome project was conceived but this idea that genetics underlies diseases was were fundamental driving force of the human genome project 
 and the idea was that if genetics were important you need to identify the genes responsible clone them out to figure out how they function to develop better diagnostic and treatment based etiologies 
 and at the time i remind you genetics was done in small labs like cottage industries around the world very slow very expensive not real productive 
 at the time our thoughts of genetics was really somewhat gene-centric in that we were looking or the field was focused more most people were focused on mutations or genetic variants of coding genes and proteins 
 now the human genome project was actually i think the culmination in some ways of a number of important discoveries in genetics and i realize in the back you may not be able to see this but earlier fundamentals and rediscovery of mendel's law the elucidation of the structure of dna which was actually a collaborative effort identifying had a sequence of genes and how to identify had a sequence of dna and how to identify genetic markers really was necessary preamble to the human genome project 
 but the project itself #* state was the first big science initiative 
 and again as i said and i think we need to remember that impetus for the human genome project was really a clinical driving force but it really led to the industrialization of science 
 and by that i mean development of new information systems new technologies which continues to advance at a tremendous rate even today when the human genome project was begone the technologies to complete the project didn't exist but they were successfully developed 
 and an important factor was that outside the war time efforts you really didn't have global industries with large r and d budgets academics and different institutions different countries governments and private industry all participating towards the common goal 
 so this is in many ways the first big science particularly the first science biology project 
 and as a result your taxpay- your tax dollars are actually contributing to a number of big science projects and some of them are listed here there's a website you can find more information about these 
 but some of these are really changing the way not only that we perform research but our understanding of science and biology and i'm gonna mention a little later the results last month of three projects deep sequencing projects genome-wide association studies and the encode project which have actually fundamentally changed in my opinion our concept of genetics of complex diseases 
 and as a geneticist i'd say the september results of the encode data is the most fundamental change in genetics since i've been in the field in 25 years 
 as a result of these big science projects the way we study human diseases is changing dramatically 
 we in addition to studying human cells we study different animal organisms mice zebra fish the fruit fly 
 and we have high throughput technologies producing data 
 so with this the emphasis is on translation you know how what have you done from the #* clinically type thing 
 but also we need to consider how genetic factors contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and i'm gonna end up talking more about that 
 so what's what's the value of understanding the genetic basis of the disease and while some of this is in #* obvious other other aspects of this i think we need to consider a bit 
 t- understanding the genetics of the disease gene contributions really helps us understand etiology 
 okay but then what can that help us do and i think this is important understanding the etiology of disease helps as determine the classification or the nosology of diseases 
 and you'll see that today when we talk about amelogenesis imperfecta clinically we talk about ai but etiologically that's due to many different it's many different etiologic forms different gene mutations cause that 
 and that's important because with that identified you can then diagnose people with specific forms of the disease 
 and importantly if you can then group those people together and instead of a one-size-all treatment you can start to to develop treatments that are based on a specific etiology of that condition 
 and i think that's really critical 
 and what we're talking about here is really personalized healthcare 
 ultimate goal is to develop a proactive a preventative healthcare system 
 but the ability to do that we're still away away from 
 and in terms of personalized healthcare i mentioned those big science projects they're really there're findings of last month they really changed how we're gonna go about this i believe 
 now you may or may not be aware that there is over 8000 inherited human disorders 
 in fact more than 35 100 mendelian disorders meaning a single gene can cause them 
 30 to 40 percent of them involve some oral dental or craniofacial phenotype 
 and in fact for genetic defects and syndromes i think the most common manifestation may be midface hypoplasia 
 but some of these diseases affect just the teeth as in ai just enamel defects or just the dentin others affects just the gingiva and then others have more pleomorphic effects affecting multiple tissues 
 and in some cases these are all totally unrelated individuals in some cases they drive development in a profound way 
 now this was an important aspect in my early work when i was a phd student there were just the technologies to develop that you can match genes from mendelian defects with you know with dna from family categories 
 and it was theoretically possible it was just beginning to to be practically performed 
 now i'm gonna talk about two conditions amelogenesis imperfecta and dentinogenesis imperfecta and i'm gonna speak about those and put them in perspective of how genetics helps us understand etiology diagnosis and treatment so that's a theme i wanna develop as i go through the the talk this this afternoon 
 ai as you are aware affects development of the enamel so it's an abnormal development of the enamel the underlined dentin is normal but radiographically what's showing here is that the enamel layer radiopaque and then it's not shown in these teeth which were affected by ai 
 now clinically ai has been described for many many many years and clinically there's 4 general types and 14 subtypes that consider a number of variables including pattern of inheritance 
 and i i've always found these are very confusing 
 and while you can find certain individuals and it's easy to classify into one of these 4 subtypes clinically it's really it becomes problematic in many many cases 
 people just don't fit into any of these 
 this is a problem for you know clinical diagnostics and it's not unique to dentistry 
 germatology the field of germatology went through has gone through a similar type of thing 
 the problem is that clinical diseases were identified and described long before we had the ability to identify the etiologic underpinnings 
 so they're imprecise and what's developing now is using incorporating them into genetics to develop better nosologies 
 now the prevalence of ai varies in different parts of the world dramatically 
 and as i mentioned it can be inherited in a number of different manners 
 it's x-linked autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive mendelian patterns of inheritance 
 now when you have a disease that's genetic you think there's a genetic basis based on f- on any of your findings for instance 
 this is an ideogram showing chromosomes 
 so the challenge is if you have a family segregating the disease initially which gene is responsible where is the gene located before we had maps of the genome or the ability to sequence as we do nowadays 
 so what was performed is sometimes called reverse genetics and basically the methodology involves gathering families phenotyping who is and who is not affected 
 and that's critical and sometimes overlooked the importance of that care for phenotyping 
 and that's where the role of good clinicians is really critical 
 but phenotyping who is not affected extracting dna and then genotyping them 
 no matter what the genetic markers you know we've talked about genetic fingerprinting and you're seeing all the forensic shows but all genetic fingerprinting was all developed for gene mapping 
 the forensics usually follows the development of genotyping techniques that have been employed for mapping genes 
 so what's done is y- sequence of genotyped individuals for different genetic polymorphisms and then try and determine which polymorphism segregates through families with a particular genotype 
 and there is mathematical algorithms that you can apply or are applied 
 and with that you can use that information to localize the causative gene for a disorder to a chromosomal location 
 you don't need to know anything about the gene involved this technique just allows you to localize the gene 
 and nowadays you can just look in and see what genes are in that genetic interval 
 you know that's on databases 
 we focused on databases because we used to have to determine what genes were in the interval 
 and then you sequence theoretically sequence through the candidate genes until you identify the genetic alteration that seems like it would be responsible for the gene defect 
 okay so that's the general approach 
 and this approach is been used to identify the genes for many of the 35 100 mendelian conditions that are reported today 
 for ai these are just some of them there's a few more recessive forms that have been identified more recently 
 but what you can see here is for instance for autosomal recessive ai mutations of multiple different genes can cause that disease 
 clinically they may have looked the same or overlapping okay 
 but the gene for these are very different the enam gene is on chromosome 4 mmp20 is on chromosome 11 
 they're totally different genes 
 what that's helping is first of all is to start to establish the nosology 
 as i mentioned before there is a parallel of germatologic conditions that look very similar part of the difficulty that was how to describe the d- correct diagnosis 
 as the genetic etiology of germatologic conditions wor- was established and this was really over the last 20 years and then treatments were developed based on specific etiologies the diagnosis and treatment of the field advanced dramatically 
 and i think that's what we're experiencing or will be experiencing in dentistry 
 a lot of work to be done but that's the direction we're going at 
 now jim simmer is gonna talk about some of these specific mutations and their effects 
 i'm gonna talk just an overview about some of the genotype-phenotype correlations and what i mean by that is when you identif- well how that how clinicians can have a role and the importance of developing this genotype-phenotype correlations 
 this slide dates me 
 this is important from when i was a dental student i just want to illustrate when i was a dental student without these names of these protei- proteinases here this is how i was taught tooth development 
 you know there is not too much specific going on here 
 you know that was really you know getting tested on that and i'm trying to think how did they wrote exam questions 
 but wanting to understand the genetic etiology we can then identify what the players are and understand the pathways that are in normal growth and development and in abnormal growth and development 
 very critical 
 now for enamel and mutations there are mutations depending on the type of mutation can cause either autosomal recessive ai or autosomal dominant ai so just knowing the gene doesn't tell you actually how the disease is gonna manifest 
 now enamelin is the most abundant protein in the enamel matrix of developing teeth and i'm going to illustrate here this is a case from families in turkey with independent families 
 we did the linkage analysis localized the gene to chromosome 4 did mutation analysis and identified the same gene mutation in probands affected individuals from different not believed to be related families 
 @void 
 since 2-base pair insertion you know the triplet codon for dna coding would cause a frameshift and change the result and protein sometimes creating a a a a premature stop codon and that's what happens here so that you have a truncated protein that's not functional 
 and what we found in examining individuals and their families you found individuals who had no copy of the mutation individuals who carried 1 copy of the mutation for instance the parents were each carriers and then affected individuals had 2 copies of the mutation 
 and these are the 3 3 of the probands from unrelated families from distant well we thought unrelated from different parts of turkey 
 so they looked in the sense they had an skeletal open bite amelogenesis imperfecta okay 2 copies of the enamelin mutation 
 when we did other studies of surrounding dna it turned out that these individuals were all related distantly related 
 so they had- back in their ancestry all inherited a common mutation from a common ancestor which is a founder effect 
 but what we also noted that with some of the individuals but they had enamel pitting and we're interested in enamel pitting because in the anthropology literature enamel pitting and- of teeth is relat- is in many cases taken as environmental challenge insult fever illness or dietary restriction 
 and i think actually what we're seeing here is there's a genetic basis for this independent of those other factors that for some people that would be normal development 
 so we had this enamel pitting sort of striking enamel pitting 
 and we look back at our families what we see here these are a family pedigree this is showing 2 carrier individuals parents this is an affected individual that has 2 copies of that enam mutation this is a sibling with 1 copy of the enam mutation these other individuals who have no copies this bars just represent individuals who we phenotype and did a dna analysis on 
 and what we found here with the individuals with 2 copies of the enam mutation had the full phenotype if you like 
 skeletal open bite amelogenesis imperfecta but the individuals who all carried 1 copy of the mutation all had this enamel pitting 
 so with this information we've starting to develop a more comprehensive first of all genotype-phenotype relationship 
 we have some as- some increased understanding of how this gene may function and we have a dean- gene dosage effect 
 where you have 2 copies of the mutation a full-blown phenotype 1 copy of a much milder phenotype 
 i wanna also mention that there's the the most common form of autosomal dominant amelogenesis seen in the usa can have a variable expression but it's due to fam81- fam83h mutations these are some of the mutations you find in turkish and american families 
 and the implication here is although we're still don't understand the gene function how this functions it does have implications for genetic testing 
 i used to practice and work in new york and the state of new york has a policy where there's money reserved to help people pay for dental genetic conditions you have a genetic condition ai di of genetical origin there was a reservoir of money to help you and for those who are familiar as a periodontist it was an eye-opener to me seeing some of these patients the cost of treating ai or di can be the order of 20 30000 dollars 
 you know so it's not insignificant 
 i had a case i had a patient came in and he had 2 daughters with ai and i said to him you know bill how are the girls doing and he said well getting ready they're getting ready to graduate and i said are they going to college and he said no tom i'm putting their money into getting their teeth fixed rather than sending them to school and i felt as a parent myself that was just a tragic thing to hear 
 so it has real implications but the point i'm trying to make is make is while the money was there previously couldn't prove they had a genetic mutation okay 
 so you couldn't access the care dollars 
 so there there are some real clinical implications here i don't know how it is in this state 
 now there's other effects for the amelogene- amelogenin gene on chromosome x you may have a phenomenon called lyonization which is inactivation of the x chromosome and it's a random inactivation 
 so i've put this here so if you're looking at a f- individual and then getting information about other family members in terms of their teeth and specifically to see if their ai males can be much more severely affected than females who can have inactivation of the chromosome that carries that gene mutation 
 so you may see this variable expression even segregating to a family 
 now having said that i want to make the point that i touched on earlier is that while clinicians dentists are not necessarily experts in genetics and there's a lot to learn although it's a constantly changing and evolving field you are experts in phenotype and there's a great need for your expertise 
 i think that when you see conditions that are a little out of the normal you will you will be able to identify them and i encourage you to delve into those a little deeper either work with others you've got your jim simmer jan hugh here and others who do genetics but you've got individuals who can help you find the mutations involved in these conditions 
 but also you can be involved with genetics counselors to help identify that 
 but what i'd make the plea for is it you get careful clinical observations and report them 
 can't tell you how important that's been in may career in figuring out the genetic bases and conditions having careful clinical observations 
 i think we went through a period of about 20 years ago for about 10 or 15 years where the emphasis wasn't placed on it it was not placed of such importance and it really is important 
 these are just some of the conditions i've work with over the years and we found gen- alterations in teeth that any dentist would be able to observe and pick up 
 but are not so obvious to our physician colleagues or geneticists on as a whole 
 now i'm going to speak a little bit of dentinogenesis imperfecta and again along our theme of how does the genetics help us understand what's happening 
 now dentin is made up of three primarily organic molecules dentin sialophosphoprotein collagen 1a1 collagen 1a2 these are coded for on different genes and genetic mutations of any one of these can cause dentinogenesis imperfecta or abnormal development of the dentin 
 now there are a number of classifications of di di that have developed over the years 
 and primarily i think as we look now with respect to what genes are involved 
 mutations of dentin sialophosphoprotein dentin sialophosphoprotein gene codes for a protein which is then split into 2 proteins that functions in enamel- in dentin development and mineralization 
 mutations of this gene cause isolated dentinogenesis imperfecta 
 however mutations of collagen 1a1 and collagen 1a2 which are on 2 different chromosomes can also cause di 
 they don't have #* 
 the collagen genes are big there's over 50 exons in each of these gens and over 500 mutations different mutations have been reported #* for each of these genes 
 these the phenotypic findings associated with mutations of these genes can be very variable from a very mild phenotype to a very severe in fact a lethal phenotype they can include things like dentinogenesis imperfecta short stature hearing loss blue sclera mitral valve prolapse aortic so cardiovascular problems bone problems okay fractures 
 @void 
 the challenge has been in the past somebody presented with di did they have isolated di was it due to dentin sialophosphoprotein mutation or did they have a form of di that had syndromic manifestations and let me show you a case that we had a few years ago with doctor paulus referred family members with dentinogenesis imperfecta that was a chief complaint 
 we started examining family members we found that some of them who were affected also had joint hyper-extensibility bone fractures increased bone fractures and they had severe joint pain the people with di reported this joint pain which i don't think had been reported previously 
 bottom line is we did genetic linkage studies and localized the gene in chromosome 17 so we knew as a collagen 1a1 gene we sequenced the gene and found a mutation in exon 32 
 so we had this specific mutation 
 and we know that this mutation is associated with dentinogenesis imperfecta some other clinical findings 
 okay changes a glycine to a cysteine okay nucleotide #* 
 and now we have a genotype-phenotype correlation if someone else is identified with this type of mutation they they know what the phenotypic findings associated with that for instance they don't need to go through a search of that type of thing and the clinicians can be on the lookout for that 
 but having that genotype-phenotype information is critical and i'm going to illustrate it with this example 
 there's another mutation of the same aminoacid same gene same aminoacid but the next nucleotide over glycine changes to an aspartic acid the phenotype associated with this is neonatal lethal it's very severe 
 and the point i'm trying to make here is although as high-throughput sequencing methodologies come on board and i'll show you an example in a little bit of where it was applied you can now sequence all the exons in somebody's genomes in about 25 hours get the data back 
 then the challenge is what what's the information telling us 
 you need to have we need to develop more robust databases of phenotypic findings with genetic alterations to be able to interpret these types of findings 
 now with dentinogenesis imperfecta specifically with dspp it was possible to sequence in the past collagen 1a1 it cost about 5000 dollars it's less than 1000 dollars now collagen 1a2 you could sequence it was about 5000 dollars significantly less now 
 and for dspp it wasn't possible to sequence the whole gene 
 what happens is there's an area of the exon 5 which is highly repetitive and there's 210 repeats of sarin sarin aspartic acid okay very hydrophilic 
 and it's a unique biological protein okay 
 and molecularly it just wasn't possible to sequence through this 
 and that was the challenge so what happened is people will sequence the parts of dspp they could and then if they didn't find a mutation reports were well it's not dspp it's got to be another gene 
 no it wasn't we just weren't being we weren't sequencing the whole gene 
 so in about 2007 2008 larry fisher and di mcknight were working with us and they developed a technique to sequence through this highly repetitive region 
 what we found is for a number of cases and now there's more by now but the majority of cases where we looked at the mutations were actually in this highly repetitive region 
 okay so broadly they were in broad strokes mutations that were inside this highly repetitive region which changed the protein produced protein from a hydrophilic repeat to a hydrophobic repeat which function very differently precipitated out and was non-functional 
 so we had sort of two classes of mutations that was important for understanding etiology and i'll show you how that's affected development or the move to develop novel treatments in a second 
 but the other thing that it did is it changed clinical the ability to clinically test for these individuals 
 so now if an individual presented with di you could go to in sequence all three of these genes and determine what the root cause was 
 if they had dspp mutations you knew this was probably the only phenotype 
 if they had mutations of these other genes you may want to have a more thorough evaluation of that individual and perhaps other affected family members 
 so clinically i think that was significant for diagnosis and for nosology 
 but something else we found is you know i think sort of in the past we assumed that if it was only di and no other findings it had to be a dspp mutation 
 and here i'm showing you two cases they're both from large families i haven't shown the pedigree here large autosomal dominant family segregating dentinogenesis imperfecta was the chief complaint 
 we went into these famil- we went in in sequence and found a collagen 1a1 mutation a novel mutation in this family and we found a collagen 1a2 mutation is responsible for di in this family 
 as we did more thorough analysis we found that actually in this family which is from brazil i'm sorry this family's from turkey they had short stature 
 so the affected individuals compared to the population norms and even their family norms were a few inches shorter slightly shorter 
 that's the only other phenotypic finding that we found very mild but this is the main finding 
 and in this case they had dentinogenesis imperfecta the only other finding we could find in all affected individuals was this wormian lambdoidal suture okay 
 #*ed and i we were doing a lot of phenotyping so you wouldn't normally perhaps have the opportunity to do this but my point is that individuals with di can have mild cases and not show other features 
 and there have been cases of individu- in families with di due to collagen mutations where it's variable expressions so one individual the main finding may be di and in not much in terms of vascular or bone findings but in other family members that have the mutation they have more significant in fact with real health consequences apart from dental for their vasculature or bone findings 
 so again i think the clinical significance isn't just developing a diagnosis in nojob- nosology but as i mentioned before certain individuals can have access to care and in medicine in general i know reimbursement patterns are different but if you have genetic diseases you're covered and now it's more you can't be discriminated against but we need to come forward with the dental aspects of these types of traits because as we'll see they're not insignificant 
 now i want to mention a little bit about how understanding the etiology can help advance development of novel etiologic based treatments 
 as another part of my research we have identified genes involved in certain kidney diseases and in fact we found genes that causes a type of kidney disease whereas a protein was made that for that destroyed cells with the ascending loop of henle 
 so basically this mutant protein destroyed the kidneys over time end stage renal disease and death if you didn't have a transplant 
 but we also found out is that mutation caused it what we call an endoplasmic reticulum store disease the mutant protein got clogged up in the endoplasmic reticulum and killed the cell 
 we're able to also use molecular chaperones to move that mutant protein out of the cell and prevent cell death 
 so we thought gee could there be correlations with certain dental diseases 
 and in fact there are 
 so this is a case for dentinogenesis imperfecta and what i want to show you here could we dim the lights a little bit please 
 is it possible 
 no okay 
 what i want to try and show here is so we have individuals i showed you before the the dspp gene so i'm not talking about that repetitive region of exon 5 
 but in in earlier exons 1 and 2 particularly 2 there are a number of mutations 
 and these cause problems in protein folding and transport of the protein 
 so what we have here normally dspp is produced in a cell and this shows a cell #dspp is produced and this is stained with an antibody 
 this is an antibody standing for the endoplasmic reticulum organelle in the in the cells 
 this is an overlay and you can see the endoplasmic reticulum and you can see the dspp being produced by the cell 
 and it's excreted we could detect this in the medium around in the cell culture 
 this is cells that have one of the mutations from dspp 
 you see the dspp is produced but it's retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and here all the dspp is in the endoplasmic reticulum you don't see it expressed outside the cell 
 and what we're able to do with this 4-phenolbutyrate and also we used colchicine so there's a number of molecular chaperones we're able to treat these mutant cell with these chemical chaperones and actually get the mutant protein to be excreted out okay 
 and that's what we show here we show different mutations 
 these are different mutations of the dspp gene this is an empty vector this is a wild-type the cell with a wild-type dspp 
 and you can see the dspp is secreted versus in these mutants much less and in fact some cases no dspp is secreted 
 when we treat them with this molecular chaperone we can get the mutated protein secreted out and in other studies we're able to demonstrate we in fact increase the longevity of the cells okay so the cells instead of going through apoptosis and dying we're able to keep them healthy and functional 
 so what i want to point out is to understanding the molecular defect you can open up the caveat it perhaps novel developmental treatments but it's not a one-size-fits-all 
 and in cancer genetics the cancer genetics has been applied to companion testing and you may or may not know but for certain specific types of cancer particular epithelial types of cancer solid tumors based on the genetic mutation you can be tested and if you have that mutation you can have very very very high success rates for treatments 
 it's amazing so again the treatment doesn't work for for certain types of cancers it doesn't work for say colon cancer won't work for everybody with colon cancer but with certain types of cancer based on the genetic etiology you can have specific treatments that are very very successful 
 i think it's a real paradigm for health care in general 
 @garbage-until-the-end 
 now and talking about this is going to think type part of the torque was the future we getting genetic information mention 
 a thousand conditions and daily the genes involved my daily entire conditions are identified how we can use this information metal first cementum torque on a pass with talk really preaching centric type genetic analysis 
 as result some pick science products mention or more that genomic the real genomic genetic determines phenotype so it's not just rotations according reasons genes cause disease and in fact 
 beg to is that only about two percent of their genome codes for genes code for proteins 
 the rest of a my track was called a as a term about carry lot of course 
 energy thing so was and we just didn't understand how function now really understand feel how functioning much more big sides products mention percent of that gene and there was percent previously for a relatively 
 narrow like be critical and clear role and regulated express an additional a large percentages majority that express or 
 so that central talk mention dna goes on a protein perhaps majority cases except to the role 
 most cases this is are which functions and understanding that can be the base for understanding to really pat- ways development of normal and normal health and disease and it's a number of regulatory regions 
 promising structure regulatory regions and other types of are a link or came out temporary anchor project there are thousands 
 and they're link change a regular pat- ways development and we know about that before incorporating know information understanding can make i think a large difference 
 to consider in terms of genetics and healthcare public ramifications public health ramifications of genetics of healthcare 
 and to that we consider relative contribution genetic factors and genetic contribution to disease can be large or can small 
 much as talk a little bit think about this for second talk about a topic variations 
 partially phenotype occurs and the base came a condition is the result the interaction about individuals genes with other genes that they had their genetic makeup and they're makeup with the environment 
 now many many many studies she was studies sequence studies have actually evaluated height and make sense as high pretty preaching phenotype get measured fairly actually pretty are currently quickly lower cost 
 so project watch that dealing with high perhaps phenotype 
 now we have individuals in this room not generally _hundred_ people line individuals up according to there height 
 online reporting the high pretty much that a normal distribution a distribution average probably about six six dentures number people gradual shorter number people tall go out multiple standard radiation arising from over for for a lower under seven 
 assay an more studies but this is the genetic variations talk about six that here on the tales most around the real 
 believe that they're about _twenty_ low simon contribute the high and determine in high we're all at so 
 transosteal factors probiotic significant they were historically 
 and internal extraction of high but now resulting is basic science project yes all for hi presence 
 to _twenty_ it's _hundred_ that five hundred _two_ _thousand_ site introduce each contribute very small amount to the total phenotype 
 and this is a parrot i for complex disease is that many many more genes contribute to them then we for 
 this so for compared and i think we can look at this is chronic periodontitis and then in second we look at maintainer forms disease patterns ever syndrome 
 that look at a larger population sample say city chicago a report that individuals within the population outside of a distribution some really train something very short with polymorphism of different types of some of different forms child is so you real training very rare but this case cause rotations genes 
 so a single rotation of a role fact receptor presentation rotation airway cholera plastic or really what you your other genetic complement that one rotation authorized all development pat- where arts high 
 several for diet so we had this paradigm i think it's holding looks like for disease as well you think about disease and contribution change thing there's the most common form a change diseases a population many many 
 each of small affect but there are rare for disease which many daily types trays daily traits can help identify what prayers are developmental pat- ways 
 thought classification of diseases and the micro on a number different metal a number different mechanisms but to say globally there can look at say three forms genetic disorders single gene disorders i discussed were rotation of a single is really determine is that the phenotype promising disorders and complex genetic diseases 
 just illustrated those a little bit vertically the crosses on disorders may or may not be aware of so development with those three mentioned 
 signature disorders i fundamentally and patterns of a hiatus and they were flattened determines fact of the technology rotation on the development of those tissues 
 simple traits there on common and terms frequency population level of a very common family percent of individuals can effect 
 from some disorders most of genetics are familiar with the trial and it tries _twenty-one_ syndrome tries to try and _thirteen_ somewhat less compared with life also model some tartar syndrome x so 
 but there's actually we look at now we're able sequence dna on a much more refine matter 
 mention a thousand conditions there are hundreds hundreds and hundreds at genetic condition contiguous centrals 
 inserted to the locations duplication of contiguous regions okay and fact rabbit really inter chromosomal a much more fine matter 
 have from some anomaly okay the question is what the phenotype affect about chromosomal deviation have to chromosomal say from your father from southern inherit say for 
 _twenty_ attention which is normally recession rotation for i had iterations orderly had one cause rotations that matter fur sometimes iterations on copper recession conditions okay variations or locations that alter metal relation patterns affect development but the pointer here as were able to introduce is another study identifying individuals over latin rate chromosomal changes 
 and you get variable clinical find depending on the genes involved which cancer related which two located 
 try to show hares historically we done sequence saying assessment many hours analyses that like this going to really virtue manual 
 now high put methodologies meta analyses able to identify copies barrier solutions _two_ locations a much more refine much a matter 
 being found is that there's have some from so there's quite expensive away chromosomal locations _two_ locations and versus which fact restorations insertion and transferred patients and as genetics that caused doing genetics increases and end of have the type of information gonna say what's the consequent and again that's remember we need to really start not staff continue 
 a type populations people have this genetic information we can determine what means stress a parrot these are two cases i've the last years that had chromosomal changes their presented the editor-in-chief of overgrowth 
 overgrowth with anomaly eruption but performed genetic analysis was able to determine not the wrong proteins 
 proteins produced by these individuals terms structure early and one case channel ram protein produced for time the mouth should normally and gingiva another they produce have efficient that produce about _fifty_ 
 percent of the normal now so this is what becoming impact reports in the future think that in a great and brief mention complex genetic disorders retro are the most common health problems okay thing 
 response things i can't ask you guys a big city in dentistry we can take a chronic tied caries 
 multiple genes environment fact important thing is realize complex diseases that hundreds of thousands and genes are gonna be involved and contribution the maxil- contribution for placement these complex trays 
 or of about point _five_ percent maxil- contribution of a locus understand understand more than currently understanding one genetic 
 separate since for sinus complex diseases just as help clinically at this point time 
 i mentioned then code on the just how that change understanding encourage hold up the code our third according paper last mouth and it's amazing really changing understanding corporation that that was another project as early 
 change rod complex diseases in that many many many working with for affect for so last three minutes i just want a finish up by talking about how thinking about genetics and public health talk about diagnostics etiology but in terms of interventions stratified 
 mention many conditions and the germs for these starting to be identified okay how we can use this information 
 the purpose perspective i put out this was lastly proper sized ventilation metal shell on in intensive care where significant number of addition genetic diseases of cause 
 there are five case were babies broad 
 what they had their genomes were sequence and _twenty-five_ hours read another _twenty-five_ hours a case of _fifty_ our to take that a sequence their genome analyses causes about _thirteen_ father our for child across a continuum going as a rush 
 and they're able to identify genetic basis of _four_ _five_ conditions okay so this is really coming the precious are coming here forces on your nail and care but 
 start provide healthcare and dentistry thing so effect back to that genome for project assess for the genetic component identify the genes can the mouth by variety methods link to association these types of things 
 we can use is develop diagnostics to develop that classification systems' and understanding classification system diagnostics used to really developing as algae the canal of the basis for developing interventions okay on going into the different true there's a variety of them smaller molecules turn of 
 replacement therapies therapies behavioral canal therapies be important to start by the future then conditions on one sides look at healthcare and and the health condition public health for familiar infection 
 as cause more significant mortality and 
 where this my mother separate from paleo and york a child saying how really clarifying thing for them parallel for awhile but so different case this is over the years prevalence have some of somebody viral conditions 
 and can see how by _ninety-nine_ for vertically eliminate on us tremendous public health success or based on understand biology and developing 
 stratified to prevent infection say matter first take you example role from remember that nature they're aids was first occurring know that caused have treatments we really look at surgery interventions cross 
 other type lesions in the oral cavity and elsewhere 
 as we understood the nature they're infected agent i first patients coming protease inhibitors and thinking boyd health 
 so set before now carefully that so understanding cause a led secondary prevention mccauley primary prevention preventing being infected or think about genetic think public health perspective okay less pocket maintainer a and trays 
 assess the advantage there is a identify take separation identify what medication is now but right now really between terms are still temporary prevention genetic diseases later on not not in person prevention 
 but when to move towards understanding basis biological pat- general talk about three and development as based on that secondary prevention a primary prevention those maybe ways by understanding are a regular mechanisms of terms of express 
 that i think matter first normal develop 
 think about complex diseases now the reason understanding then code on other project require more understanding okay i think that so we understand african and they have such fact canal by the change and they're interaction 
 modifiers over come they're affecting but effect so small so many genes parrot a involve much deeper understanding of helping development be able to bring public health 
 prevention and treatment to complex diseases 
 i wanted thanks are via colleagues can work done without what break collaborating and somebody individuals 
 incisal boston and internal know care line and real participate one for their support over the years
