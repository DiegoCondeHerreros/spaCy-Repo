@void  O

   
okay  O
so  O
thank  O
you  O
dean  B-MISC
polverini  I-MISC
and  O
i'd  B-MISC
also  O
like  O
to  O
thank  O
laurie  B-MISC
mccauley  I-MISC
for  O
the  O
organisation  O
of  O
this  O
session  O
today  O

   
i'm  O
going  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
our  O
our  O
discussions  O
that  O
we're  O
going  O
to  O
have  O
later  O
and  O
i've  B-MISC
very  O
much  O
appreciated  O
doctor  O
hassel's  B-MISC
presentation  O
giving  O
a  O
big  O
picture  O
to  O
you  O
on  O
the  O
world  O
of  O
personalised  O
medicine  O
as  O
it  O
may  O
affect  O
all  O
areas  O
of  O
healthcare  O

   
and  O
so  O
my  O
challenge  O
this  O
afternoon  O
is  O
to  O
now  O
put  O
into  O
perspective  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
opportunities  O
that  O
we  O
have  O
in  O
dentistry  O
notably  O
in  O
the  O
areas  O
of  O
dental  O
caries  O
periodontal  O
diseases  O
and  O
oral  O
cancer  O
as  O
examples  O
where  O
we  O
may  O
be  O
able  O
to  O
now  O
start  O
using  O
personalized  O
oral  O
healthcare  O
or  O
personalized  O
dentistry  O
for  O
the  O
better  O
healthcare  O
delivery  O
for  O
our  O
patients  O

   
genetics  O
what  O
can  O
that  O
mean  O
the  O
ability  O
to  O
perfect  O
the  O
physical  O
and  O
mental  O
characteristics  O
of  O
every  O
unborn  O
child  O

   
#*  O

   
in  O
a  O
not  O
too  O
distant  O
future  O

   
our  O
dna  B-MISC
will  O
determine  O
everything  O
about  O
us  O

   
a  O
minute  O
drop  O
of  O
blood  O

   
saliva  O
or  O
single  O
hair  O

   
determines  O
where  O
you  O
can  O
work  O

   
who  O
you  O
should  O
marry  O

   
what  O
you're  O
capable  O
of  O
achieving  O

   
@music  O

   
okay  O
so  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
movie  O
clip  O
from  O
gattaca  B-MISC
and  O
many  O
of  O
us  O
might  O
think  O
that  O
this  O
is  O
actually  O
pretty  O
far-fetched  O

   
but  O
actually  O
much  O
of  O
the  O
technology  O
that  O
was  O
utilized  O
in  O
the  O
premise  O
of  O
this  O
movie  O
is  O
actually  O
available  O
today  O

   
and  O
it's  O
really  O
a  O
matter  O
of  O
how  O
we're  O
going  O
to  O
use  O
this  O
genetic  O
information  O
for  O
genetics  O
and  O
genomics  O
research  O
and  O
the  O
application  O
of  O
really  O
using  O
it  O
in  O
a  O
in  O
a  O
proper  O
manner  O
and  O
so  O

   
as  O
a  O
part  O
of  O
the  O
presentation  O
today  O
later  O
on  O
doctor  O
roberts  B-MISC
is  O
really  O
gonna  O
put  O
much  O
of  O
this  O
into  O
the  O
the  O
clinical  O
context  O

   
but  O
as  O
we  O
start  O
to  O
now  O
begin  O
to  O
consider  O
many  O
of  O
the  O
opportunities  O
within  O
personalized  O
dentistry  O
and  O
personalized  O
healthcare  O

   
i  O
think  O
i  B-MISC
can  O
relate  O
to  O
many  O
areas  O
that  O
we  O
have  O
currently  O
ongoing  O
in  O
dentistry  O
and  O
in  O
oral  O
health  O
research  O

   
this  O
isn't  O
even  O
just  O
at  O
the  O
patient  O
level  O
but  O
can  O
also  O
relate  O
to  O
the  O
the  O
response  O
to  O
microbial  O
infection  O

   
if  O
we  O
take  O
for  O
example  O
in  O
periodontal  O
diseases  O
and  O
dental  O
caries  O

   
using  O
molecular  O
diagnostic  O
approaches  O
in  O
identifying  O
different  O
types  O
of  O
pathogens  O
that  O
are  O
afflicting  O
our  O
patients  O
and  O
seeing  O
how  O
that  O
host  O
parasite  O
interaction  O
actually  O
occurs  O

   
also  O
in  O
the  O
development  O
of  O
rapid  O
point-of-care  O
diagnostic  O
tests  O
we  O
are  O
going  O
to  O
have  O
many  O
opportunities  O
not  O
only  O
working  O
with  O
centralized  O
laboratories  O
like  O
what  O
doctor  O
hassel  B-MISC
just  O
recently  O
presented  O

   
but  O
in  O
the  O
future  O
we  O
are  O
now  O
beginning  O
to  O
have  O
rapid  O
point-of-care  O
diagnosticswhere  O
we  O
might  O
even  O
have  O
devices  O
the  O
size  O
of  O
this  O
pointer  O
here  O
we're  O
going  O
to  O
be  O
able  O
to  O
deliver  O
some  O
sort  O
of  O
biological  O
specimen  O
and  O
then  O
have  O
an  O
analysis  O
of  O
our  O
genomes  O

   
so  O
you  O
know  O
how  O
can  O
we  O
actually  O
start  O
using  O
these  O
approaches  O
because  O
in  O
dentistry  O
you  O
know  O
we've  O
been  O
using  O
a  O
form  O
of  O
personalized  O
medicine  O
for  O
many  O
years  O
right  O

   
we  O
treat  O
each  O
patient  O
differently  O
it's  O
not  O
necessarily  O
one-size-fits-all  O

   
however  O
when  O
it  O
comes  O
to  O
many  O
of  O
the  O
different  O
tools  O
that  O
we  O
have  O
in  O
our  O
armamentarium  O
restorative  O
biomaterials  O
antibiotics  O
pain  O
medications  O
often  O
times  O
we  O
do  O
use  O
them  O
in  O
a  O
very  O
standardized  O
manner  O

   
and  O
so  O
if  O
we  O
take  O
one  O
example  O
such  O
as  O
in  O
a  O
case  O
of  O

   
this  O
was  O
actually  O
the  O
development  O
of  O
a  O
of  O
a  O
new  O
tissue  O
engineering  O
construct  O
part  O
of  O
a  O
randomized  O
control  O
trial  O
done  O
here  O
at  O
the  O
university  B-MISC
of  O
michigan  B-MISC

   
this  O
is  O
an  O
example  O
of  O
a  O
patient  O
who  O
had  O
a  O
very  O
severe  O
osseous  O
defect  O
around  O
a  O
single  O
tooth  O

   
and  O
this  O
patient  O
received  O
a  O
treatment  O
that  O
was  O
highly  O
successful  O

   
and  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
10  O
year  O
post-operative  O
image  O
following  O
this  O
treatment  O

   
but  O
this  O
another  O
patient  O
in  O
the  O
same  O
clinical  O
trial  O
received  O
the  O
same  O
tissue  O
engineering  O
construct  O
and  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
at  O
baseline  O
and  O
then  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
at  O
the  O
6  O
month  O
post-operative  O
view  O
that  O
this  O
patient  O
went  O
the  O
opposite  O
direction  O

   
and  O
so  O
how  O
do  O
we  O
actually  O
identify  O
these  O
patients  O
who  O
are  O
going  O
to  O
respond  O
well  O
and  O
those  O
who  O
may  O
not  O
respond  O
quite  O
so  O
well  O

   
so  O
this  O
is  O
actually  O
some  O
other  O
data  O
from  O
this  O
this  O
multi-center  O
clinical  O
trial  O
and  O
it  O
shows  O
a  O
distribution  O
as  O
we  O
would  O
examine  O
of  O
the  O
patients  O
maybe  O
in  O
our  O
practice  O
or  O
the  O
practices  O
we're  O
planning  O
on  O
going  O
into  O
where  O
we  O
really  O
get  O
differential  O
responses  O
to  O
therapies  O

   
so  O
this  O
is  O
essentially  O
a  O
graphic  O
that  O
displays  O
the  O
proportion  O
of  O
patients  O
okay  O
so  O
going  O
up  O
to  O
a  O
100  O
percent  O
of  O
the  O
patients  O
versus  O
the  O
percent  O
osseous  O
defect  O
fill  O
for  O
this  O
regenerative  O
treatment  O

   
and  O
so  O
what  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
either  O
using  O
a  O
standard  O
of  O
care  O
or  O
two  O
different  O
bone  O
grafting  O
biomaterials  O

   
there  O
was  O
more  O
predictability  O
if  O
you  O
will  O
in  O
this  O
green  O
group  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
more  O
of  O
the  O
patients  O
showing  O
better  O
regeneration  O

   
however  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
subset  O
of  O
patients  O
at  O
the  O
very  O
bottom  O
where  O
these  O
patients  O
didn't  O
have  O
any  O
you  O
know  O
the  O
result  O
was  O
really  O
negative  O
whereas  O
you  O
can  O
also  O
see  O
in  O
the  O
control  O
there  O
was  O
a  O
large  O
group  O
of  O
patients  O
that  O
performed  O
very  O
well  O

   
so  O
you  O
know  O
why  O
do  O
these  O
patients  O
respond  O
differently  O

   
what  O
what  O
are  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
reasons  O
for  O
this  O
and  O
is  O
there  O
a  O
way  O
for  O
us  O
to  O
customize  O
our  O
treatments  O
that  O
we  O
deliver  O

   
and  O
so  O
so  O
much  O
in  O
dentistry  O
because  O
we  O
do  O
tend  O
to  O
follow  O
the  O
surgical  O
model  O
of  O
healthcare  O
delivery  O
we  O
will  O
either  O
blame  O
the  O
patient  O
in  O
their  O
compliance  O
or  O
we  O
will  O
blame  O
you  O
know  O
the  O
practitioner  O
they  O
don't  O
have  O
the  O
hands  O
that  O
i  B-MISC
have  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
actually  O
delivering  O
this  O
care  O

   
and  O
certainly  O
these  O
are  O
factors  O
compliance  O
are  O
going  O
to  O
modulate  O
a  O
great  O
deal  O
the  O
clinician  O
skill  O
is  O
going  O
to  O
have  O
a  O
big  O
role  O

   
it  O
might  O
have  O
been  O
the  O
targeting  O
of  O
the  O
drug  O
or  O
device  O
within  O
that  O
particular  O
defect  O
or  O
much  O
of  O
it  O
might  O
be  O
based  O
on  O
the  O
patient's  O
inherent  O
ability  O
to  O
respond  O
to  O
this  O
particular  O
treatment  O

   
and  O
so  O
some  O
patients  O
may  O
have  O
a  O
much  O
better  O
response  O
than  O
his  O
doctor  O
has  O
we're  O
showing  O
some  O
patients  O
are  O
just  O
incapable  O
of  O
responding  O
to  O
a  O
specific  O
drug  O
because  O
they  O
don't  O
express  O
the  O
receptor  O
to  O
enable  O
them  O
to  O
have  O
a  O
robust  O
response  O
to  O
that  O
drug  O

   
so  O
a  O
large  O
part  O
of  O
what  O
i  B-MISC
will  O
be  O
discussing  O
this  O
afternoon  O
is  O
is  O
on  O
saliva  O
diagnostic  O
testing  O

   
on  O
how  O
we  O
might  O
be  O
able  O
to  O
now  O
start  O
using  O
these  O
rapid  O
diagnostics  O
for  O
the  O
identification  O
of  O
disease  O

   
we  O
might  O
be  O
able  O
to  O
get  O
a  O
better  O
handle  O
on  O
clinical  O
response  O
identifying  O
risk  O
that  O
will  O
then  O
affect  O
our  O
prognosis  O

   
you  O
know  O
part  O
of  O
our  O
initial  O
exam  O
developing  O
a  O
diagnosis  O
and  O
then  O
developing  O
a  O
prognosis  O
to  O
say  O
in  O
the  O
treatment  O
planning  O
how  O
is  O
this  O
patient  O
going  O
to  O
respond  O

   
also  O
we  O
can  O
look  O
at  O
susceptibility  O
and  O
this  O
becomes  O
very  O
challenging  O
because  O
it  O
does  O
intersect  O
with  O
environmental  O
and  O
compliance  O
related  O
aspects  O

   
this  O
could  O
be  O
patients  O
who  O
may  O
have  O
a  O
specific  O
genetic  O
profile  O
but  O
they're  O
infected  O
with  O
other  O
types  O
of  O
pathogens  O
that  O
gonna  O
put  O
them  O
at  O
greater  O
risk  O
for  O
disease  O

   
and  O
then  O
also  O
looking  O
at  O
the  O
different  O
drug  O
targets  O
doctor  O
hassel  B-MISC
has  O
given  O
some  O
examples  O

   
so  O
this  O
particular  O
topic  O
oftentimes  O
when  O
you  O
hear  O
a  O
presentation  O
about  O
diagnostics  O
you  O
know  O
how  O
how  O
are  O
we  O
actually  O
going  O
to  O
use  O
these  O
diagnostic  O
tests  O
in  O
our  O
practices  O

   
and  O
so  O
it  O
becomes  O
very  O
difficult  O
because  O
in  O
general  O
in  O
dentistry  O
we  O
don't  O
have  O
very  O
orderly  O
protocols  O
that  O
are  O
standardized  O
for  O
us  O
to  O
deliver  O
care  O

   
and  O
so  O
how  O
is  O
this  O
going  O
to  O
help  O
me  O
deliver  O
better  O
care  O
to  O
the  O
patient  O
and  O
so  O
you  O
know  O
one  O
very  O
broad  O
concept  O
on  O
how  O
these  O
tests  O
can  O
be  O
used  O
could  O
be  O
from  O
a  O
simple  O
public  O
health  O
standpoint  O
where  O
we  O
are  O
able  O
to  O
identify  O
those  O
patients  O
at  O
highest  O
risk  O

   
and  O
do  O
massive  O
screening  O
and  O
then  O
help  O
bring  O
those  O
patients  O
to  O
the  O
clinic  O
for  O
them  O
to  O
get  O
a  O
more  O
in-depth  O
evaluation  O

   
example  O
in  O
oral  O
pathology  O
could  O
be  O
the  O
screening  O
and  O
identification  O
of  O
salivary  O
il  B-MISC
8  O
that  O
might  O
predispose  O
these  O
patients  O
to  O
squamous  O
cell  O
carcinoma  O

   
and  O
then  O
they  O
need  O
to  O
go  O
to  O
the  O
oral  O
pathologist  O
for  O
an  O
exam  O
and  O
then  O
maybe  O
eventually  O
a  O
biopsy  O
that  O
is  O
evaluated  O
to  O
really  O
determine  O
is  O
that  O
a  O
true  O
local  O
you  O
know  O
oral  O
cancer  O

   
so  O
these  O
technologies  O
i'm  B-MISC
gonna  O
give  O
you  O
some  O
examples  O
now  O
but  O
you  O
know  O
this  O
intercess-  O
intersection  O
between  O
dentistry  O
and  O
engineering  O
and  O
the  O
life  O
sciences  O
there  O
are  O
many  O
different  O
platforms  O
for  O
disease  O
detection  O
that  O
are  O
quite  O
of  O
that  O
are  O
becoming  O
available  O

   
and  O
this  O
was  O
actually  O
a  O
report  O
on  O
the  O
use  O
of  O
potentially  O
the  O
use  O
of  O
an  O
ipad  O
or  O
and  O
iphone  O
that  O
you  O
can  O
actually  O
drop  O
saliva  O
on  O
to  O
this  O
device  O
as  O
a  O
pseudo-lab-on-a-chip  O
device  O

   
for  O
the  O
capacitance  O
of  O
that  O
saliva  O
that  O
drops  O
onto  O
the  O
these  O
touch  O
screens  O
can  O
actually  O
then  O
identify  O
the  O
capacitance  O
of  O
different  O
types  O
of  O
microbial  O
species  O
so  O
it  O
could  O
actually  O
differentiate  O
the  O
quantity  O
of  O
microbes  O

   
it's  O
it's  O
very  O
early  O
stage  O
i  B-MISC
don't  O
think  O
we're  O
gonna  O
be  O
using  O
it  O
you  O
know  O
in  O
spitting  O
on  O
our  O
screens  O
anytime  O
soon  O
but  O
we're  O
gonna  O
have  O
devices  O
that  O
can  O
do  O
multiple  O
functions  O

   
so  O
as  O
was  O
just  O
mentioned  O
in  O
the  O
previous  O
talk  O
about  O
you  O
know  O
the  O
cautionary  O
tales  O
of  O
some  O
of  O
this  O
the  O
genetic  O
testing  O

   
actually  O
when  O
doctor  O
mccauley  B-MISC
asked  O
me  O
to  O
give  O
this  O
presentation  O
i've  B-MISC
been  O
aware  O
of  O
this  O
technology  O
and  O
actually  O
just  O
for  O
fun  O
i  B-MISC
decided  O
to  O
have  O
my  O
genome  O
evaluated  O
using  O
this  O
saliva  O
test  O
which  O
actually  O
has  O
now  O
gone  O
through  O
several  O
iterations  O

   
and  O
this  O
is  O
basically  O
a  O
very  O
easy  O
to  O
use  O
genetic  O
test  O
that  O
you  O
know  O
the  O
disclaimer  O
on  O
this  O
is  O
that  O
it's  O
only  O
for  O
research  O
purposes  O
it  O
is  O
not  O
connected  O
to  O
anything  O
that  O
a  O
healthcare  O
practitioner  O
is  O
using  O
currently  O

   
however  O
i  B-MISC
gotta  O
i  B-MISC
must  O
say  O
when  O
i  B-MISC
got  O
the  O
results  O
back  O
i  B-MISC
mean  O
i  B-MISC
did  O
have  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O
of  O
a  O
drop  O
in  O
my  O
blood  O
pressure  O
just  O
waiting  O
to  O
see  O
what  O
was  O
going  O
to  O
come  O
out  O
from  O
this  O

   
but  O
as  O
such  O
it's  O
a  O
very  O
easy  O
to  O
use  O
test  O
kit  O
where  O
you  O
log  O
on  O
to  O
this  O
online  O
then  O
you  O
receive  O
a  O
sample  O
test  O
kit  O

   
you  O
you  O
provide  O
about  O
2  O
mls  O
of  O
saliva  O
there're  O
some  O
different  O
protease  O
inhibitors  O
that  O
are  O
put  O
into  O
this  O
concoction  O
it's  O
mailed  O
off  O
and  O
then  O
you  O
get  O
the  O
results  O
in  O
about  O
6  O
to  O
8  O
weeks  O

   
so  O
these  O
these  O
tests  O
are  O
being  O
used  O
actually  O
quite  O
often  O
this  O
was  O
from  O
the  O
new  B-MISC
york  I-MISC
times  I-MISC
a  O
couple  O
of  O
years  O
ago  O
where  O
they  O
were  O
having  O
a  O
saliva  O
party  O

   
and  O
these  O
are  O
people  O
with  O
in  O
the  O
background  O
sipping  O
champagne  O
and  O
having  O
a  O
wine  O
and  O
cheese  O
tasting  O
and  O
then  O
spitting  O
over  O
in  O
the  O
other  O
side  O
giving  O
up  O
their  O
saliva  O
that  O
then  O
they  O
were  O
going  O
to  O
get  O
their  O
genomes  O
evaluated  O

   
so  O
when  O
i  B-MISC
received  O
the  O
results  O
actually  O
it  O
comes  O
back  O
and  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
component  O
of  O
it  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
ancestral  O
painting  O
and  O
it  O
looks  O
at  O
the  O
haplogroups  O
of  O
both  O
your  O
mother  O
and  O
your  O
father  O

   
and  O
you  O
know  O
my  O
mother  O
was  O
primarily  O
irish  B-MISC
and  O
my  O
father  O
from  O
southern  O
italy  B-MISC
area  O
and  O
so  O
there  O
was  O
you  O
know  O
these  O
these  O
test  O
kit  O
sort  O
of  O
really  O
provide  O
very  O
general  O
identification  O
of  O
regions  O
such  O
as  O
europe  B-MISC
africa  I-MISC
and  O
asia  B-MISC

   
and  O
so  O
at  O
least  O
i  B-MISC
was  O
the  O
composition  O
of  O
me  O
was  O
what  O
i  B-MISC
thought  O
it  O
was  O
but  O
you  O
never  O
know  O

   
and  O
then  O
then  O
it  O
starts  O
to  O
have  O
this  O
report  O
that  O
comes  O
out  O
that  O
identifies  O
multiple  O
genes  O
multiple  O
risk  O
factors  O
for  O
a  O
variety  O
of  O
diseases  O

   
and  O
doctor  O
roberts  B-MISC
he's  O
gonna  O
go  O
into  O
some  O
of  O
this  O
interpretation  O
and  O
that's  O
what  O
much  O
of  O
the  O
caution  O
is  O
of  O
these  O
specific  O
results  O

   
and  O
so  O
this  O
is  O
an  O
example  O
of  O
some  O
areas  O
that  O
i  B-MISC
was  O
at  O
decreased  O
risk  O
for  O
and  O
much  O
of  O
this  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
confidence  O
so  O
for  O
the  O
students  O
learning  O
about  O
evidence-based  O
dentistry  O
evidence-based  O
medicine  O

   
this  O
does  O
in  O
its  O
own  O
way  O
look  O
at  O
a  O
hierarchy  O
of  O
evidence  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
multiple  O
randomized  O
controlled  O
trials  O
meta-analyses  O
or  O
very  O
large  O
clinical  O
studies  O
being  O
a  O
higher  O
confidence  O
for  O
a  O
an  O
end-point  O

   
whereas  O
then  O
they  O
also  O
do  O
all  O
kinds  O
of  O
other  O
exploratory  O
and  O
earlier  O
stage  O
less  O
confident  O
results  O

   
and  O
so  O
it's  O
for  O
those  O
students  O
in  O
my  O
lab  O
it  O
says  O
i'm  B-MISC
at  O
decreased  O
risk  O
for  O
alzheimer's  B-MISC
if  O
you're  O
wondering  O

   
and  O
then  O
it  O
has  O
then  O
it  O
goes  O
into  O
several  O
other  O
areas  O
that  O
have  O
much  O
less  O
confidence  O

   
and  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
this  O
is  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
the  O
education  O
piece  O
you  O
know  O
there  O
are  O
reports  O
that  O
come  O
back  O
for  O
other  O
diseases  O
that  O
there  O
might  O
be  O
a  O
concern  O
so  O
for  O
example  O
longevity  O

   
it  O
tells  O
me  O
to  O
see  O
a  O
report  O
because  O
it's  O
telling  O
me  O
i'm  B-MISC
actually  O
probably  O
not  O
gonna  O
be  O
a  O
centurion  O

   
you  O
know  O
i'm  B-MISC
there  O
are  O
a  O
variety  O
of  O
different  O
risk  O
factors  O

   
but  O
i  B-MISC
if  O
we  O
just  O
take  O
one  O
for  O
tooth  O
development  O
for  O
example  O
what  O
is  O
nice  O
is  O
that  O
there  O
are  O
links  O
then  O
to  O
the  O
references  O
that  O
are  O
then  O
related  O
to  O
this  O
particular  O
gene  O
and  O
so  O
in  O
this  O
case  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
single  O
nucleotide  O
polymorphism  O
that  O
is  O
associated  O
with  O
t-  O
with  O
either  O
supernumerary  O
teeth  O
or  O
missing  O
teeth  O

   
and  O
so  O
this  O
is  O
just  O
an  O
example  O
based  O
on  O
a  O
very  O
large  O
study  O
and  O
you  O
can  O
even  O
link  O
to  O
this  O
open  O
access  O
article  O
that  O
shows  O
that  O
there  O
were  O
just  O
over  O
8000  O
patients  O
and  O
they  O
had  O
looked  O
at  O
the  O
risk  O
of  O
having  O
supernumerary  O
teeth  O
or  O
not  O

   
in  O
this  O
particular  O
case  O
i  B-MISC
was  O
going  O
to  O
based  O
on  O
my  O
profile  O
i  B-MISC
was  O
only  O
going  O
i  B-MISC
was  O
gonna  O
have  O
a  O
normal  O
number  O
of  O
teeth  O

   
so  O
these  O
these  O
technologies  O
have  O
some  O
value  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
what  O
is  O
available  O
out  O
there  O

   
but  O
obviously  O
they're  O
going  O
to  O
be  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
ramifications  O
on  O
how  O
they're  O
used  O
later  O
in  O
practice  O

   
okay  O
so  O
as  O
we  O
think  O
about  O
now  O
just  O
some  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
most  O
common  O
examples  O
where  O
saliva  O
diagnostics  O
have  O
been  O
used  O
in  O
dentistry  O

   
these  O
are  O
that  O
three  O
areas  O
periodontal  O
disease  O
oral  O
cancer  O
and  O
dental  O
caries  O

   
however  O
i  B-MISC
don't  O
mean  O
to  O
be  O
limiting  O
in  O
that  O
it  O
is  O
really  O
being  O
applied  O
to  O
all  O
areas  O
of  O
dentistry  O
and  O
these  O
were  O
just  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
lower  O
hanging  O
fruit  O
that  O
have  O
been  O
evaluated  O
in  O
several  O
different  O
situations  O
so  O

   
if  O
we  O
think  O
about  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
periodontal  O
disease  O
evaluation  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
a  O
chronic  O
disease  O
if  O
used  O
it  O
as  O
a  O
chronic  O
disease  O
model  O
itself  O
there  O
are  O
several  O
junction  O
points  O
where  O
diagnostic  O
testing  O
can  O
be  O
quite  O
valuable  O

   
at  O
the  O
early  O
stage  O
in  O
the  O
genetic  O
evaluation  O
just  O
like  O
what  O
i  B-MISC
showed  O
you  O
there  O
may  O
be  O
genetic  O
test  O
for  O
disease  O
that  O
come  O
out  O

   
it  O
doesn't  O
really  O
address  O
the  O
epigenetic  O
changes  O
eric  B-MISC
had  O
a  O
really  O
great  O
question  O
because  O
chronic  O
diseases  O
are  O
very  O
susceptible  O
to  O
epigenetic  O
changes  O
that  O
are  O
really  O
going  O
to  O
affect  O
the  O
phenotype  O

   
and  O
then  O
we  O
have  O
the  O
biological  O
onset  O
of  O
the  O
disease  O
this  O
might  O
be  O
at  O
the  O
microscopic  O
level  O
it's  O
sub-clinical  O

   
and  O
you  O
know  O
how  O
can  O
we  O
identify  O
that  O
very  O
early  O
carious  O
lesion  O
or  O
the  O
initiation  O
of  O
periodontal  O
disease  O

   
our  O
detection  O
tests  O
we  O
hope  O
are  O
very  O
close  O
to  O
the  O
biological  O
onset  O
but  O
not  O
always  O
so  O
sometimes  O
they're  O
more  O
closer  O
to  O
the  O
actual  O
clinical  O
measures  O
the  O
radiograph  O
the  O
increased  O
pocket  O
depth  O
the  O
bleeding  O
these  O
sorts  O
of  O
overt  O
signs  O

   
and  O
so  O
what  O
we  O
wanna  O
do  O
is  O
develop  O
tests  O
that  O
don't  O
just  O
corroborate  O
what  O
we  O
already  O
see  O
clinically  O
but  O
might  O
help  O
us  O
screen  O
patients  O
more  O
rapidly  O

   
and  O
so  O
this  O
then  O
leads  O
into  O
the  O
development  O
of  O
more  O
rapid  O
point-of-care  O
diagnostics  O
where  O
we  O
can  O
move  O
beyond  O
the  O
conventional  O
methods  O
that  O
we've  O
used  O
before  O
that  O
are  O
very  O
important  O
for  O
validation  O

   
but  O
now  O
starting  O
to  O
exploit  O
many  O
of  O
the  O
different  O
molecular  O
techniques  O
that  O
will  O
help  O
us  O
do  O
a  O
very  O
rapid  O
assessment  O
that  O
may  O
be  O
able  O
to  O
be  O
done  O
at  O
the  O
chair  O
side  O

   
to  O
identify  O
those  O
patients  O
at  O
risk  O
for  O
disease  O
and  O
give  O
us  O
more  O
of  O
a  O
real  O
time  O
assessment  O
of  O
what's  O
going  O
on  O
and  O
this  O
is  O
where  O
many  O
of  O
the  O
protein  O
biomarkers  O
have  O
been  O
used  O

   
so  O
they  O
can  O
be  O
used  O
in  O
in  O
you  O
know  O
in  O
periodontal  O
practices  O
i  B-MISC
mentioned  O
screening  O
monitoring  O
dental  O
hygienists  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
supportive  O
periodontal  O
therapy  O
visits  O
identifying  O
those  O
patients  O
that  O
are  O
undergoing  O
disease  O
progression  O

   
identification  O
of  O
teeth  O
that  O
are  O
at  O
high  O
risk  O
for  O
future  O
progression  O
and  O
maybe  O
you  O
remove  O
this  O
pier  O
abutment  O
tooth  O
for  O
this  O
bridge  O
because  O
it  O
doesn't  O
have  O
a  O
good  O
prognosis  O
and  O
then  O
lastly  O
diagnosis  O
of  O
very  O
specific  O
diseases  O

   
so  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
things  O
that  O
we  O
have  O
an  O
opportunity  O
to  O
do  O
is  O
within  O
periodontics  O
of  O
the  O
localized  O
periodontal  O
lesion  O
we  O
know  O
that  O
plaque  O
biofilms  O
elicit  O
a  O
host  O
immune  O
response  O
and  O
then  O
there's  O
a  O
whole  O
cascade  O
of  O
events  O
in  O
response  O
to  O
that  O
microbial  O
colonization  O

   
and  O
it  O
depends  O
on  O
the  O
patient  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
the  O
release  O
of  O
different  O
tissue  O
destructive  O
molecules  O
associated  O
with  O
disease  O
progression  O

   
and  O
so  O
you  O
know  O
there's  O
been  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
work  O
done  O
in  O
the  O
saliva  O
area  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
identifying  O
many  O
of  O
these  O
mediators  O
that  O
are  O
released  O
from  O
the  O
saliva  O
many  O
of  O
them  O
very  O
large  O
molecular  O
weight  O
molecules  O
other  O
of  O
them  O
smaller  O
molecules  O
that  O
may  O
or  O
may  O
not  O
be  O
associated  O
with  O
disease  O

   
and  O
so  O
i'll  B-MISC
show  O
you  O
one  O
example  O
that  O
the  O
research  O
team  O
at  O
mcohr  B-MISC
the  O
michigan  B-MISC
center  I-MISC
for  O
oral  B-MISC
health  I-MISC
research  I-MISC
has  O
been  O
involved  O
with  O
a  O
collaboration  O
with  O
the  O
department  B-MISC
of  O
energy  B-MISC
group  O
sandia  B-MISC
national  I-MISC
labs  I-MISC
and  O
mcohr  B-MISC

   
and  O
this  O
is  O
really  O
working  O
in  O
the  O
development  O
of  O
a  O
handheld  O
diagnostic  O
that  O
could  O
be  O
used  O
to  O
put  O
in  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
drops  O
of  O
saliva  O
to  O
then  O
give  O
an  O
output  O
of  O
a  O
rapid  O
diagnosis  O
in  O
a  O
matter  O
of  O
minutes  O
versus  O
what  O
i  B-MISC
call  O
the  O
brute  O
force  O
method  O
in  O
the  O
lab  O
that  O
might  O
take  O
a  O
day  O
or  O
two  O
or  O
sometimes  O
longer  O

   
so  O
this  O
is  O
an  O
example  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
a  O
proof-of-principle  O

   
where  O
we  O
essentially  O
took  O
we  O
examined  O
one  O
specific  O
mediator  O
of  O
disease  O
matrix  B-MISC
metalloproteinase  I-MISC
released  O
from  O
neutrophils  O
connected  O
with  O
periodontal  O
disease  O

   
and  O
we  O
took  O
a  O
group  O
of  O
healthy  O
dental  O
hygienists  O
and  O
than  O
we  O
took  O
a  O
group  O
of  O
diseased  O
patients  O
then  O
looked  O
at  O
the  O
use  O
of  O
this  O
prototype  O
diagnostic  O
to  O
predict  O
disease  O

   
and  O
so  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
internal  O
workings  O
of  O
the  O
device  O
and  O
so  O
it  O
basically  O
has  O
an  O
a  O
sample  O
collection  O
area  O
a  O
filtration  O
of  O
the  O
large  O
molecular  O
weight  O
proteins  O
and  O
then  O
a  O
very  O
small  O
volume  O
of  O
saliva  O
will  O
will  O
traverse  O
this  O
device  O
and  O
then  O
in  O
a  O
matter  O
of  O
4  O
to  O
10  O
minutes  O
getting  O
an  O
output  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
the  O
level  O
of  O
a  O
specific  O
biomarker  O

   
so  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
handheld  O
device  O
it's  O
it's  O
fairly  O
large  O
of  O
minutes  O
it's  O
got  O
8  O
different  O
double  O
a  B-MISC
batteries  O
and  O
as  O
it's  O
not  O
quite  O
as  O
small  O
as  O
this  O
but  O
it  O
still  O
could  O
be  O
at  O
the  O
chair  O
side  O

   
so  O
this  O
is  O
an  O
example  O
of  O
of  O
fluorescein-labeled  O
saliva  O
that  O
is  O
put  O
into  O
this  O
device  O
and  O
essentially  O
one  O
only  O
needs  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
about  O
50  O
nanoliters  O
or  O
so  O
of  O
saliva  O
to  O
go  O
into  O
this  O
device  O

   
it  O
traverses  O
through  O
the  O
device  O
and  O
then  O
it  O
was  O
benchmarked  O
to  O
a  O
standard  O
enzyme-linked  O
immunosorbent  O
assay  O
an  O
eliza  B-MISC
from  O
the  O
laboratory  O

   
and  O
what  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
on  O
this  O
plot  O
is  O
basically  O
using  O
the  O
micro-capillary  O
electrophoresis  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
eliza  B-MISC
they  O
related  O
very  O
well  O
so  O
this  O
test  O
was  O
just  O
as  O
good  O
as  O
the  O
brute  O
force  O
method  O

   
and  O
then  O
if  O
you  O
look  O
at  O
the  O
groups  O
of  O
patients  O
i  B-MISC
got  O
to  O
mention  O
the  O
healthy  O
the  O
moderate  O
disease  O
and  O
severe  O
periodontitis  O
using  O
this  O
detection  O
device  O
you  O
could  O
see  O
that  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
strong  O
readout  O
for  O
those  O
patients  O
who  O
have  O
elevated  O
levels  O
of  O
one  O
of  O
these  O
different  O
biomarkers  O
mmp-8  B-MISC

   
so  O
and  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
size  O
of  O
the  O
these  O
chips  O
that  O
can  O
be  O
dropped  O
in  O
and  O
out  O
of  O
the  O
device  O
to  O
then  O
you  O
can  O
drop  O
in  O
the  O
protein  O
of  O
interest  O
to  O
measure  O
that  O
within  O
the  O
the  O
fluid  O

   
so  O
we've  O
been  O
able  O
to  O
use  O
this  O
then  O
for  O
the  O
evaluation  O
of  O
multiple  O
different  O
biomarkers  O

   
and  O
so  O
now  O
you  O
start  O
to  O
get  O
a  O
greater  O
robustness  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
using  O
different  O
components  O
of  O
the  O
disease  O
process  O
microbial  O
pathogens  O

   
using  O
different  O
markers  O
of  O
inflammation  O
and  O
then  O
markers  O
of  O
tissue  O
destruction  O
in  O
the  O
same  O
readout  O
and  O
so  O
these  O
are  O
what  O
are  O
called  O
oral  O
c-curves  B-MISC
in  O
terms  O
of  O
the  O
the  O
false  O
positive  O
rate  O
and  O
the  O
true  O
positive  O
rate  O
and  O
so  O
these  O
curves  O
are  O
basically  O
as  O
you  O
go  O
to  O
the  O
upper  O
left-hand  O
corner  O
you're  O
getting  O
a  O
stronger  O
result  O

   
and  O
so  O
a  O
greater  O
predictability  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
an  O
odds  O
ratio  O
in  O
these  O
2  O
cases  O
of  O
10  O
and  O
24  O
increased  O
risk  O
of  O
periodontal  O
disease  O
if  O
a  O
patient  O
has  O
for  O
example  O
increased  O
levels  O
of  O
matrix  B-MISC
metalloproteinase  I-MISC
8  O
and  O
they're  O
infected  O
with  O
treponema  B-MISC
denticola  I-MISC
a  O
pathogen  O
highly  O
associated  O
with  O
periodontitis  O

   
right  O
and  O
so  O
that's  O
just  O
taking  O
a  O
snapshot  O
and  O
we  O
already  O
have  O
the  O
tools  O
available  O
to  O
identify  O
you  O
know  O
if  O
someone  O
has  O
periodontal  O
disease  O
or  O
not  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
as  O
clinicians  O
we  O
know  O
this  O

   
but  O
then  O
how  O
do  O
we  O
identify  O
those  O
people  O
who  O
are  O
gonna  O
undergo  O
progression  O

   
and  O
certainly  O
there  O
are  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
factors  O
that  O
dictate  O
that  O

   
but  O
this  O
was  O
part  O
of  O
doing  O
a  O
longitudinal  O
study  O
where  O
we  O
took  O
a  O
100  O
patients  O
and  O
then  O
we  O
followed  O
them  O
for  O
one  O
year  O

   
and  O
during  O
that  O
one  O
year  O
period  O
at  O
2  O
month  O
intervals  O
they  O
were  O
they  O
did  O
not  O
receive  O
any  O
treatment  O
so  O
they  O
were  O
we  O
were  O
disease  O
monitoring  O

   
so  O
from  O
an  O
ethical  O
standpoint  O
if  O
someone  O
underwent  O
progression  O
then  O
they  O
received  O
local  O
treatment  O
but  O
it  O
wasn't  O
more  O
than  O
2  O
millimeters  O
of  O
of  O
tissue  O
loss  O
we  O
we  O
monitored  O
them  O
through  O
the  O
study  O

   
and  O
so  O
after  O
that  O
6  O
months  O
of  O
observation  O
then  O
we  O
delivered  O
care  O

   
measured  O
progressive  O
bone  O
loss  O
progressive  O
soft  O
tissue  O
loss  O

   
so  O
this  O
may  O
not  O
project  O
very  O
well  O
my  O
apologies  O

   
this  O
is  O
just  O
a  O
patient  O
flow  O
that  O
demonstrates  O
the  O
the  O
disposition  O
of  O
the  O
patients  O
throughout  O
the  O
trial  O
and  O
the  O
the  O
numbers  O
of  O
patients  O
that  O
were  O
screened  O
and  O
out  O
of  O
the  O
100  O
that  O
were  O
entered  O
83  O
completed  O
the  O
6  O
month  O
portion  O
of  O
the  O
study  O
that  O
i'll  B-MISC
show  O
you  O
the  O
results  O
on  O

   
so  O
basically  O
these  O
4  O
panels  O
demonstrate  O
radiographic  O
soft  O
tissue  O
and  O
inflammatory  O
markers  O
over  O
time  O

   
so  O
again  O
disease  O
monitoring  O
the  O
first  O
6  O
months  O
and  O
then  O
treatment  O
at  O
6  O
months  O
and  O
then  O
we  O
looked  O
at  O
what  O
happened  O
after  O
those  O
first  O
6  O
months  O

   
and  O
so  O
as  O
as  O
predicted  O
the  O
periodontal  O
disease  O
didn't  O
get  O
better  O
over  O
time  O
it  O
tended  O
to  O
progress  O
and  O
then  O
when  O
the  O
patients  O
received  O
treatment  O
there  O
were  O
improvements  O
steady  O
improvements  O
in  O
those  O
particular  O
cases  O

   
so  O
then  O
the  O
part  O
that  O
we  O
are  O
more  O
interested  O
in  O
is  O
to  O
then  O
look  O
at  O
the  O
different  O
biomarkers  O

   
the  O
the  O
signatures  O
if  O
you  O
will  O
of  O
disease  O
over  O
time  O
and  O
then  O
looking  O
at  O
the  O
real  O
time  O
assessment  O
of  O
disease  O

   
and  O
so  O
we  O
looked  O
at  O
30  O
different  O
biomarkers  O
but  O
there  O
was  O
6  O
of  O
them  O
that  O
were  O
most  O
clos-  O
closely  O
evaluated  O
mmp-8  B-MISC
mmp-9  I-MISC
osteoprotegerin  O
and  O
calprotectin  O

   
and  O
so  O
what  O
we're  O
able  O
to  O
do  O
is  O
that  O
these  O
different  O
biomarkers  O
respond  O
differentially  O
obviously  O
to  O
disease  O
progression  O
and  O
then  O
resolution  O
of  O
disease  O

   
and  O
so  O
then  O
we  O
were  O
able  O
to  O
take  O
this  O
information  O
and  O
put  O
it  O
together  O
and  O
then  O
connect  O
it  O
with  O
the  O
clinical  O
outcomes  O

   
you  O
know  O
did  O
a  O
patient  O
get  O
better  O
or  O
did  O
a  O
patient  O
get  O
worse  O
following  O
the  O
treatment  O

   
so  O
i'll  B-MISC
i'll  I-MISC
put  O
you  O
through  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
cluster  O
analysis  O
that  O
then  O
puts  O
together  O
clinical  O
microbiological  O
protein  O
biomarker  O
and  O
serum  O
assessments  O
of  O
disease  O

   
and  O
essentially  O
if  O
a  O
patient  O
had  O
this  O
particular  O
profile  O
of  O
elevated  O
and  O
reduced  O
levels  O
of  O
these  O
particular  O
biomarkers  O
and  O
it's  O
probably  O
not  O
so  O
critically  O
important  O
that  O
we  O
go  O
through  O
each  O
one  O
of  O
them  O
except  O
to  O
say  O
that  O
there  O
was  O
a  O
signature  O
if  O
a  O
patient  O
had  O
this  O
profile  O
they  O
tended  O
to  O
undergo  O
disease  O
progression  O

   
whereas  O
if  O
a  O
patient  O
had  O
the  O
bottom  O
profile  O
which  O
you  O
could  O
see  O
that  O
this  O
was  O
really  O
suggestive  O
even  O
in  O
the  O
face  O
of  O
a  O
microbial  O
challenge  O
without  O
treatment  O
these  O
patients  O
did  O
better  O

   
and  O
they  O
either  O
remain  O
stable  O
or  O
even  O
slightly  O
improved  O
so  O
these  O
are  O
the  O
patients  O
who  O
are  O
at  O
lower  O
risk  O
for  O
disease  O
progression  O

   
so  O
that  O
was  O
an  O
example  O
with  O
periodontal  O
disease  O
and  O
that  O
flowchart  O
just  O
demonstrate  O
it's  O
very  O
difficult  O
to  O
get  O
the  O
specific  O
types  O
of  O
patients  O
periodontal  O
disease  O
not  O
as  O
common  O

   
and  O
so  O
one  O
of  O
our  O
graduate  O
students  O
in  O
the  O
periodontics  B-MISC
program  I-MISC
angie  I-MISC
lee  I-MISC
actually  O
embarked  O
on  O
a  O
much  O
more  O
common  O
oral  O
disease  O
that  O
is  O
gingivitis  O

   
and  O
what  O
she  O
did  O
is  O
look  O
at  O
genetic  O
microbiological  O
and  O
protein  O
biomarkers  O
that  O
could  O
predict  O
whether  O
or  O
not  O
somebody  O
had  O
an  O
exacerbated  O
gingival  O
inflammatory  O
profile  O

   
so  O
this  O
uses  O
the  O
classical  O
experimental  O
gingivitis  O
model  O
where  O
patients  O
cease  O
oral  O
hygiene  O
for  O
a  O
period  O
of  O
21  O
days  O
and  O
then  O
you  O
watch  O
the  O
development  O
of  O
the  O
plaque  O
biofilm  O
you  O
watch  O
the  O
development  O
of  O
the  O
inflammation  O

   
and  O
surprisingly  O
this  O
study  O
was  O
very  O
easy  O
to  O
enroll  O

   
it  O
was  O
the  O
patients  O
were  O
paid  O
a  O
stipend  O
to  O
enroll  O
and  O
we've  O
got  O
a  O
very  O
large  O
number  O
of  O
college  B-MISC
students  O
who  O
enrolled  O
in  O
this  O
study  O

   
and  O
essentially  O
they  O
undergo  O
a  O
pretrial  O
phase  O
they're  O
brought  O
to  O
a  O
stage  O
of  O
oral  O
health  O
and  O
then  O
they  O
cease  O
all  O
oral  O
hygiene  O
for  O
21  O
days  O
then  O
they  O
undergo  O
a  O
prophylaxis  O

   
and  O
so  O
what  O
we  O
did  O
was  O
we  O
stratified  O
these  O
patients  O
based  O
on  O
a  O
susceptibility  O
factor  O
that  O
i'll  B-MISC
talk  O
about  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O
later  O
called  O
a  O
susceptibility  O
factor  O
for  O
a  O
polymorphism  O
of  O
the  O
interleukin  B-MISC
1  O
beta  O
gene  O

   
and  O
it's  O
within  O
the  O
promoter  O
region  O
and  O
i'll  B-MISC
show  O
you  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O
more  O
about  O
that  O
later  O

   
patients  O
divided  O
by  O
that  O
factor  O
and  O
then  O
we  O
looked  O
at  O
their  O
progression  O
of  O
disease  O

   
and  O
so  O
this  O
il-1  B-MISC
polymorphism  O
what  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
here  O
is  O
within  O
the  O
promoter  O
region  O
there  O
are  O
2  O
locations  O
this  O
il-1  B-MISC
a  I-MISC
and  O
il-1  B-MISC
b  I-MISC
components  O
of  O
that  O
gene  O

   
and  O
if  O
there's  O
a  O
polymorphism  O
in  O
those  O
locations  O
that  O
can  O
be  O
picked  O
up  O
by  O
this  O
rapid  O
and  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
saliva  O
test  O
then  O
the  O
patients  O
are  O
identified  O
as  O
high  O
risk  O
for  O
developing  O
inflammation  O

   
and  O
this  O
is  O
connected  O
with  O
other  O
chronic  O
inflammatory  O
diseases  O
such  O
as  O
crohn's  B-MISC
disease  O
inflammatory  B-MISC
bowel  I-MISC
and  O
some  O
of  O
these  O
other  O
types  O
of  O
diseases  O

   
and  O
so  O
what  O
it  O
was  O
able  O
to  O
then  O
be  O
used  O
for  O
is  O
identifying  O
patients  O
who  O
are  O
at  O
higher  O
risk  O
for  O
over  O
the  O
21  O
days  O
to  O
display  O
a  O
gingival  O
index  O
of  O
2  O
or  O
3  O
so  O
that's  O
almost  O
spontaneous  O
bleeding  O

   
whereas  O
other  O
patients  O
who  O
really  O
don't  O
and  O
we  O
see  O
them  O
people  O
who  O
don't  O
brush  O
their  O
teeth  O
and  O
they  O
they  O
still  O
do  O
pretty  O
good  O
they  O
do  O
well  O

   
and  O
so  O
you  O
know  O
how  O
do  O
you  O
discriminate  O
between  O
those  O
patients  O

   
and  O
so  O
we  O
looked  O
at  O
and  O
this  O
was  O
a  O
collaboration  O
with  O
the  O
forsyth  B-MISC
institute  I-MISC
looking  O
at  O
each  O
one  O
of  O
these  O
time  O
points  O

   
it's  O
not  O
so  O
important  O
i  B-MISC
know  O
you  O
can't  O
read  O
the  O
different  O
pathogens  O
there  O

   
but  O
looking  O
at  O
40  O
different  O
pathogens  O
and  O
then  O
you  O
basically  O
have  O
a  O
fingerprint  O
of  O
the  O
plaque  O
biofilm  O
on  O
the  O
plaque  O
biofilm  O
on  O
the  O
tooth  O
root  O
surface  O

   
and  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
the  O
blue  O
line  O
is  O
the  O
genetic  O
polymorphism  O
and  O
then  O
the  O
orange  O
line  O
is  O
the  O
negative  O
the  O
il-1  B-MISC
of  O
the  O
patients  O
who  O
don't  O
have  O
the  O
polymorphism  O

   
and  O
there  O
was  O
really  O
no  O
difference  O

   
and  O
these  O
studies  O
usually  O
with  O
polymorphisms  O
you  O
need  O
large  O
numbers  O
of  O
patients  O
to  O
see  O
something  O

   
but  O
what  O
was  O
interesting  O
was  O
that  O
those  O
patients  O
who  O
had  O
the  O
propensity  O
to  O
develop  O
the  O
inflammatory  O
phenotype  O

   
these  O
patients  O
tended  O
to  O
have  O
high  O
levels  O
of  O
interleukin  B-MISC
8  O
matrix  O
metalloproteinase  I-MISC
8  O
and  O
f  B-MISC
nucleatum  O
polymorphum  O

   
and  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
that  O
these  O
patients  O
were  O
at  O
increased  O
risk  O
of  O
d-  O
of  O
displaying  O
that  O
profile  O

   
so  O
again  O
just  O
another  O
example  O
of  O
using  O
these  O
approaches  O
to  O
predict  O
an  O
oral  O
condition  O

   
so  O
the  O
other  O
area  O
of  O
oral  O
cancer  O
and  O
actually  O
that  O
topic  O
was  O
very  O
well  O
covered  O
by  O
doctor  O
hassel  B-MISC
i'm  I-MISC
just  O
going  O
to  O
give  O
you  O
a  O
vignette  O
of  O
how  O
saliva  O
diagnostics  O
are  O
being  O
used  O
for  O
oral  O
cancer  O

   
and  O
again  O
the  O
same  O
paradigm  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
screening  O
and  O
then  O
bringing  O
the  O
patient  O
to  O
the  O
clinician  O
surgeon  O
for  O
histopathological  O
evaluations  O
is  O
the  O
real  O
the  O
main  O
concept  O

   
and  O
so  O
if  O
we  O
look  O
at  O
the  O
disease  O
prevalence  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
you  O
know  O
it's  O
a  O
cancer  O
even  O
though  O
the  O
proximity  O
and  O
being  O
able  O
to  O
visualize  O
it  O
the  O
outcomes  O
are  O
still  O
not  O
outstanding  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
oral  O
cancer  O
survival  O

   
so  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
very  O
important  O
need  O
for  O
the  O
development  O
of  O
oral  O
cancer  O
diagnostics  O

   
and  O
so  O
one  O
research  O
group  O
at  O
the  O
ucla  B-MISC
school  I-MISC
of  O
dentistry  B-MISC
david  I-MISC
wong's  I-MISC
group  O
has  O
developed  O
a  O
platform  O
that  O
actually  O
is  O
readily  O
accessible  O
and  O
he  O
shared  O
these  O
slides  O
with  O
me  O
he  O
calls  O
it  O
the  O
salivaomics  B-MISC
knowledge  I-MISC
base  I-MISC

   
and  O
he's  O
he's  O
received  O
quite  O
a  O
bit  O
of  O
funding  O
from  O
the  O
nidcr  B-MISC
in  O
the  O
development  O
of  O
this  O
database  O
and  O
then  O
just  O
very  O
recently  O
he  O
has  O
received  O
funding  O
as  O
part  O
of  O
a  O
u-award  B-MISC
that  O
will  O
be  O
collaborating  O
with  O
him  O
on  O
to  O
look  O
at  O
a  O
variety  O
of  O
diseases  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
development  O
of  O
chair-side  O
diagnostics  O
for  O
oral  O
cancer  O
detection  O

   
and  O
so  O
very  O
similar  O
to  O
the  O
other  O
type  O
of  O
diagnostic  O
i  B-MISC
showed  O
you  O

   
they  O
have  O
now  O
developed  O
a  O
platform  O
at  O
ucla  B-MISC
were  O
they  O
have  O
these  O
different  O
cassettes  O
that  O
can  O
be  O
dropped  O
into  O
this  O
device  O

   
again  O
for  O
a  O
rapid  O
evaluation  O
of  O
a  O
variety  O
of  O
diseases  O
oral  O
cancer  O
as  O
one  O
of  O
them  O
using  O
il-8  B-MISC
but  O
also  O
for  O
pancreatic  O
cancer  O
diabetes  O
screening  O
and  O
others  O

   
and  O
so  O
what  O
we're  O
starting  O
to  O
see  O
is  O
that  O
many  O
of  O
these  O
different  O
diagnostics  O
are  O
coming  O
down  O
the  O
pipeline  O

   
dental  O
caries  O

   
this  O
is  O
an  O
area  O
in  O
the  O
last  O
several  O
years  O
there  O
has  O
been  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
progress  O
being  O
made  O
in  O
the  O
development  O
of  O
different  O
diagnostics  O
i  B-MISC
mean  O
we've  O
known  O
for  O
a  O
long  O
time  O
the  O
importance  O
of  O
diet  O
and  O
oral  O
hygiene  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
dental  O
caries  O

   
however  O
it  O
also  O
has  O
been  O
shown  O
by  O
a  O
variety  O
of  O
of  O
researchers  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
in  O
this  O
room  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
genetics  O
of  O
dental  O
caries  O

   
and  O
so  O
with  O
the  O
use  O
of  O
genome-wide  B-MISC
association  O
studies  O
or  O
gwas  B-MISC
screening  O
now  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
very  O
robust  O
ability  O
to  O
identify  O
a  O
variety  O
of  O
different  O
snps  B-MISC
there  O
are  O
associated  O
with  O
disease  O
and  O
so  O
this  O
particular  O
study  O
from  O
the  O
group  O
at  O
the  O
university  B-MISC
of  O
pittsburgh  B-MISC
what  O
they  O
have  O
been  O
able  O
to  O
identify  O
is  O
their  O
predictions  O
from  O
this  O
large  O
study  O
was  O
that  O
40  O
to  O
60  O
percent  O
of  O
dental  O
caries  O
is  O
really  O
associated  O
with  O
genetics  O
the  O
genetics  O
of  O
the  O
disease  O
that's  O
what  O
they  O
believe  O
from  O
their  O
study  O

   
and  O
the  O
other  O
patient  O
compliance  O
aspects  O
diet  O
making  O
up  O
the  O
other  O
part  O

   
it's  O
very  O
similar  O
to  O
periodontal  O
disease  O

   
genetics  O
appears  O
to  O
be  O
responsible  O
for  O
about  O
50  O
percent  O
of  O
periodontal  O
disease  O
as  O
well  O

   
and  O
the  O
use  O
of  O
taste  O
genes  O
this  O
was  O
i  B-MISC
thought  O
quite  O
quite  O
interesting  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
certain  O
patients  O
have  O
a  O
predilection  O
for  O
wanting  O
to  O
go  O
after  O
the  O
sugary  O
foods  O
and  O
so  O
the  O
same  O
group  O
actually  O
identified  O
these  O
taste  O
genes  O
that  O
put  O
patients  O
at  O
you  O
know  O
they  O
can't  O
control  O
themselves  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
wanting  O
the  O
the  O
sugary  O
foods  O
to  O
to  O
put  O
them  O
at  O
higher  O
risk  O
for  O
dental  O
caries  O
and  O
so  O

   
there's  O
been  O
a  O
large  O
amount  O
of  O
work  O
done  O
in  O
this  O
area  O

   
and  O
so  O
this  O
is  O
just  O
an  O
example  O
from  O
that  O
large  O
gwas  B-MISC
study  O
identifying  O
on  O
a  O
variety  O
of  O
different  O
chromosomal  O
locations  O
different  O
snps  B-MISC
that  O
are  O
putting  O
patients  O
at  O
greater  O
risk  O
for  O
the  O
development  O
of  O
dental  O
caries  O

   
treatment  O
planning  O

   
i  O
will  O
show  O
you  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
last  O
part  O
of  O
my  O
presentation  O
as  O
as  O
we  O
look  O
at  O
the  O
delivery  O
of  O
care  O
for  O
our  O
patients  O
the  O
treatment  O
planning  O
aspects  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
are  O
are  O
very  O
important  O
and  O
so  O

   
if  O
i  B-MISC
give  O
this  O
example  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
it's  O
important  O
in  O
clinical  O
care  O
delivery  O
obviously  O
the  O
compliance  O
patients  O
control  O
of  O
oral  O
hygiene  O
measures  O
if  O
we  O
talk  O
about  O
periodontal  O
disease  O
again  O
using  O
it  O
as  O
a  O
model  O
and  O
really  O
combining  O
the  O
role  O
of  O
the  O
bacterial  O
challenge  O
and  O
then  O
the  O
host  O
response  O
that  O
is  O
the  O
makeup  O
of  O
the  O
patient  O
that  O
may  O
have  O
either  O
been  O
dictated  O
by  O
genetics  O
or  O
epigenetics  O
which  O
also  O
i'm  B-MISC
skipping  O
over  O
that  O
for  O
this  O
talk  O

   
but  O
epigenetic  O
changes  O
clearly  O
have  O
a  O
very  O
big  O
role  O
in  O
periodontal  O
disease  O
just  O
due  O
to  O
you  O
know  O
you've  O
got  O
decades  O
of  O
pathogens  O
bathing  O
the  O
soft  O
tissues  O
and  O
after  O
a  O
period  O
of  O
time  O
we  O
know  O
there's  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
dna  B-MISC
hypermethylation  O
around  O
the  O
teeth  O
themselves  O

   
and  O
so  O
if  O
we  O
really  O
look  O
at  O
these  O
2  O
these  O
2  O
aspects  O
and  O
coming  O
back  O
to  O
these  O
different  O
either  O
polymorphisms  O
which  O
there  O
have  O
been  O
at  O
least  O
80  O
connected  O
with  O
risk  O
of  O
periodontal  O
disease  O
and  O
the  O
il-1  B-MISC
gene  O
variations  O
have  O
been  O
the  O
most  O
well  O
studied  O

   
so  O
gave  O
the  O
example  O
of  O
gingival  O
inflammation  O
but  O
also  O
very  O
related  O
to  O
periodontal  O
disease  O
progression  O

   
and  O
so  O
this  O
is  O
probably  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
the  O
best  O
study  O
that  O
was  O
done  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
group  O
of  O
patients  O
in  O
sweden  B-MISC
they're  O
part  O
of  O
a  O
very  O
large  O
maintenance  O
practice  O
so  O
very  O
homogeneous  O
patient  O
population  O
and  O
as  O
ken  B-MISC
kornman  I-MISC
likes  O
to  O
call  O
these  O
are  O
a  O
100  O
percent  O
viking  B-MISC
population  O
of  O
patients  O

   
these  O
these  O
individuals  O
were  O
followed  O
for  O
a  O
period  O
of  O
time  O
from  O
1988  O
to  O
1998  O

   
they  O
all  O
had  O
risk  O
factors  O
for  O
periodontal  O
disease  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
this  O
was  O
quite  O
interesting  O

   
as  O
he  O
looked  O
at  O
those  O
patients  O
who  O
don't  O
smoke  O
and  O
we  O
know  O
smoking  O
is  O
a  O
big  O
risk  O
factor  O
for  O
periodontal  O
disease  O
also  O
negative  O
for  O
the  O
polymorphism  O
il-1  B-MISC
they  O
have  O
lower  O
disease  O
progression  O
if  O
we  O
look  O
at  O
an  O
output  O
of  O
tooth  O
loss  O

   
you  O
can  O
measure  O
attachment  O
level  O
but  O
if  O
you  O
start  O
losing  O
teeth  O
that's  O
a  O
very  O
that's  O
that's  O
the  O
best  O
thing  O
we  O
have  O
in  O
dentistry  O
to  O
mortality  O
tooth  O
mortality  O

   
and  O
looking  O
at  O
what  O
happens  O
there  O
versus  O
these  O
patients  O
that  O
either  O
have  O
1  O
of  O
the  O
risk  O
factors  O
either  O
a  O
non-smoker  O
in  O
il-1  B-MISC
positive  O
or  O
a  O
smoker  O
in  O
il-1  B-MISC
negative  O

   
increased  O
risk  O
however  O
when  O
you  O
combine  O
these  O
2  O
il-1  O
and  O
a  O
smoker  O
then  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
these  O
patients  O
are  O
at  O
a  O
big  O
risk  O
for  O
developing  O
progressive  O
disease  O
and  O
eventually  O
tooth  O
loss  O

   
so  O
this  O
then  O
led  O
into  O
a  O
collaboration  O
with  O
interleukin  B-MISC
genetics  I-MISC

   
ken  O
kornman  I-MISC
chief  I-MISC
scientific  I-MISC
officer  I-MISC
at  O
interleukin  B-MISC
genetics  I-MISC
and  O
he  O
is  O
actually  O
recently  O
our  O
#*  O
for  O
visiting  O
professor  O
and  O
a  O
#*  O
of  O
our  O
perio  O
program  O

   
we've  O
and  O
they  O
just  O
put  O
out  O
this  O
press  O
release  O
today  O
just  O
coincidentally  O
of  O
the  O
completion  O
of  O
a  O
very  O
large  O
study  O
that  O
we  O
did  O
in  O
collaboration  O
with  O
interleukin  B-MISC

   
to  O
now  O
connect  O
genetic  O
evaluation  O
and  O
see  O
if  O
it  O
can  O
relate  O
to  O
personalized  O
healthcare  O
and  O
how  O
you  O
would  O
deliver  O
something  O
very  O
simple  O
such  O
as  O
maintenance  O
therapy  O
to  O
patients  O
to  O
patients  O
globally  O
not  O
just  O
patients  O
with  O
periodontitis  O
but  O
pat-  O
the  O
standard  O
6  O
month  O
profi  O

   
and  O
we  O
don't  O
even  O
know  O
why  O
we  O
use  O
6  O
months  O
right  O

   
i  O
mean  O
it's  O
the  O
toothbrush  O
companies  O
set  O
up  O
this  O
paradigm  O
of  O
6  O
months  O
and  O
it's  O
worked  O
very  O
well  O
but  O
we  O
know  O
it's  O
overkill  O
for  O
some  O
patients  O
and  O
some  O
patients  O
that's  O
not  O
enough  O
maintenance  O
care  O

   
and  O
so  O
if  O
we  O
can  O
use  O
that  O
model  O
that  O
you  O
just  O
saw  O
from  O
the  O
the  O
the  O
swedish  B-MISC
study  O
then  O
we  O
want  O
to  O
look  O
at  O
okay  O
larger  O
patient  O
populations  O
can  O
that  O
help  O
us  O
customize  O
our  O
care  O

   
so  O
the  O
primary  O
objective  O
of  O
this  O
investigation  O
was  O
to  O
then  O
look  O
at  O
evaluate  O
dental  O
patients  O
who  O
are  O
classified  O
as  O
low-risk  O
so  O
we  O
looked  O
at  O
a  O
group  O
of  O
individuals  O
between  O
the  O
ages  O
of  O
30  O
and  O
50  O
who  O
essentially  O
had  O
no  O
periodontal  O
procedures  O
so  O
we  O
looked  O
at  O
claims  O
data  O

   
right  O
and  O
then  O
look  O
at  O
practitioners  O
clinical  O
decision  O
making  O
so  O
we  O
had  O
the  O
the  O
end  O
the  O
end  O
results  O
were  O
tooth  O
loss  O
or  O
patients  O
who  O
received  O
advanced  O
periodontal  O
procedures  O

   
did  O
they  O
have  O
scaling  O
and  O
root  O
planing  O
did  O
they  O
receive  O
periodontal  O
surgery  O
and  O
then  O
the  O
outcome  O
is  O
tooth  O
loss  O

   
to  O
see  O
what  O
happens  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
tooth  O
loss  O

   
so  O
we  O
recruited  O
patients  O
and  O
basically  O
targeted  O
a  O
group  O
of  O
individuals  O
these  O
were  O
actually  O
the  O
michigan  B-MISC
teachers  I-MISC
association  I-MISC
primarily  O
now  O
retired  O
teachers  O
and  O
they're  O
a  O
very  O
compliant  O
group  O
we  O
found  O
out  O

   
and  O
they  O
send  O
us  O
letters  O
all  O
the  O
time  O
if  O
we  O
do  O
a  O
misstep  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
materials  O
we  O
send  O
them  O
it's  O
a  O
so  O

   
and  O
what  O
has  O
been  O
interesting  O
is  O
that  O
so  O
we  O
stratified  O
the  O
recruitment  O
of  O
the  O
patients  O
based  O
on  O
these  O
different  O
risk  O
factors  O
and  O
then  O
we  O
also  O
had  O
15  O
years  O
of  O
data  O

   
that  O
these  O
patients  O
came  O
to  O
the  O
dental  O
office  O
at  O
least  O
once  O
or  O
twice  O
a  O
year  O
for  O
15  O
years  O

   
so  O
we're  O
really  O
looking  O
at  O
a  O
very  O
well  O
documented  O
patient  O
population  O

   
so  O
the  O
group  O
at  O
the  O
michigan  B-MISC
center  I-MISC
for  O
oral  B-MISC
health  I-MISC
research  I-MISC
then  O
worked  O
with  O
michr  B-MISC
and  O
we  O
basically  O
contacted  O
a  O
large  O
number  O
of  O
patients  O
and  O
then  O
we  O
sent  O
out  O
9900  O
patients  O
agreed  O
to  O
participate  O
in  O
this  O
study  O

   
and  O
then  O
out  O
of  O
those  O
9900  O
i'll  O
show  O
you  O
the  O
the  O
the  O
metrics  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
what  O
we  O
received  O

   
but  O
we  O
would  O
send  O
them  O
basically  O
demographic  O
information  O
for  O
them  O
to  O
provide  O
us  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
a  O
dna  B-MISC
sample  O
that  O
originally  O
can  O
be  O
used  O
to  O
look  O
at  O
this  O
one  O
study  O
question  O
and  O
eventually  O
you  O
may  O
be  O
able  O
to  O
look  O
through  O
gwas  B-MISC
screening  O
other  O
different  O
snps  B-MISC
associated  O
with  O
periodontal  O
disease  O

   
then  O
the  O
patients  O
they  O
did  O
these  O
swabs  O
themselves  O
at  O
home  O
and  O
then  O
sent  O
the  O
samples  O
to  O
us  O

   
so  O
out  O
of  O
the  O
32000  O
patients  O
originally  O
consented  O
i'll  B-MISC
show  O
you  O
the  O
number  O
that  O
agreed  O
to  O
participate  O
so  O
about  O
just  O
over  O
a  O
third  O
of  O
them  O
agreed  O
but  O
then  O
once  O
we  O
sent  O
them  O
the  O
kit  O
then  O
it  O
was  O
about  O
another  O
half  O
of  O
them  O
once  O
they  O
really  O
started  O
seeing  O
the  O
genetic  O
information  O
there  O
some  O
of  O
them  O
you  O
know  O
were  O
still  O
unwilling  O
to  O
participate  O
or  O
just  O
didn't  O
submit  O
the  O
kits  O

   
but  O
we  O
received  O
just  O
over  O
54  O
100  O
of  O
these  O
and  O
then  O
what  O
we'll  O
be  O
doing  O
now  O
in  O
the  O
next  O
few  O
months  O
is  O
now  O
answering  O
those  O
study  O
questions  O
to  O
determine  O
whether  O
or  O
not  O
that  O
has  O
a  O
risk  O
so  O
there'll  O
be  O
there'll  O
be  O
more  O
come  O
on  O
that  O
to  O
see  O
how  O
that  O
can  O
work  O
but  O
that's  O
really  O
in  O
essence  O
an  O
example  O
of  O
of  O
a  O
way  O
using  O
it  O
for  O
personalized  O
healthcare  O

   
so  O
my  O
last  O
three  O
slides  O
really  O
thinking  O
that  O
as  O
we  O
bring  O
this  O
into  O
perspective  O
looking  O
at  O
saliva  O
diagnostics  O
we  O
may  O
be  O
able  O
to  O
be  O
able  O
may  O
be  O
able  O
to  O
have  O
something  O
set  O
up  O
where  O
we  O
can  O
do  O
chair-side  O
based  O
diagnostics  O
in  O
the  O
clinical  O
practice  O
for  O
a  O
rapid  O
readout  O
of  O
information  O

   
and  O
as  O
we  O
move  O
forward  O
really  O
these  O
are  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
key  O
issues  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
that  O
this  O
will  O
end  O
up  O
being  O
a  O
good  O
segway  O
for  O
doctor  O
roberts  B-MISC
because  O
there  O
are  O
all  O
kinds  O
of  O
science  O
policy  O
issues  O
and  O
things  O
of  O
that  O
nature  O
they're  O
are  O
really  O
going  O
to  O
be  O
important  O
for  O
us  O
to  O
assess  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
how  O
we're  O
going  O
to  O
use  O
this  O
information  O

   
obviously  O
we  O
have  O
to  O
have  O
good  O
tests  O
they  O
have  O
to  O
be  O
predictable  O
and  O
they  O
will  O
not  O
make  O
it  O
to  O
the  O
chair  O
side  O
unless  O
they  O
perform  O
in  O
that  O
manner  O
we  O
have  O
to  O
connect  O
this  O
with  O
education  O
from  O
several  O
sides  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
the  O
counseling  O

   
there  O
are  O
different  O
biobanks  O
that  O
are  O
being  O
set  O
up  O

   
#*  O
has  O
biobanks  O
also  O
the  O
uk  B-MISC
has  O
a  O
large  O
bio  O
bank  B-MISC
of  O
saliva  O
serum  O
looking  O
at  O
health  O
outcomes  O
of  O
patients  O
of  O
the  O
united  B-MISC
kingdom  I-MISC
this  O
will  O
be  O
valuable  O

   
and  O
then  O
lastly  O
confidentiality  O

   
so  O
with  O
that  O
i  B-MISC
like  O
to  O
thank  O
you  O
for  O
your  O
attention  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
also  O
like  O
to  O
thank  O
the  O
groups  O
of  O
from  O
our  O
lab  O
group  O
and  O
all  O
those  O
at  O
michigan  B-MISC
center  I-MISC
for  O
oral  B-MISC
health  I-MISC
research  I-MISC
thank  O
you  O

   
material  O
sciences  O
so  O
well  O
really  O
like  O
to  O
thank  O
you  O
for  O
sharing  O
your  O
genetic  O
data  O
with  O
us  O
because  O
can  O
confirmed  O
what  O
many  O
of  O
us  O
knew  O
virtue  O
all  O
along  O
and  O
that  O
that  O
is  O
indeed  O
you  O
are  O
better  O
than  O
average  O
and  O
the  O
categories  O

   
so  O
i  B-MISC
was  O
watching  O
and  O
thinking  O
through  O
presentation  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
of  O
other  O
potential  O
really  O
fabulous  O
things  O
do  O
these  O
diagnostics  B-MISC

   
but  O
that  O
i  B-MISC
was  O
more  O
in  O
our  O
typical  O
dental  O
practices  O
all  O
these  O
things  O
are  O
fee  O
for  O
services  O
and  O

   
i  O
thought  O
maybe  O
is  O
can  O
i  B-MISC
we  O
even  O
be  O
the  O
pay  O
for  O
this  O
practices  O
whereas  O
it  O
perhaps  O
fits  O
more  O
medical  O
model  O
where  O
a  O
physician  O
can  O
do  O
this  O
and  O
have  O
insurance  O
reimburse  O
so  O
even  O
though  O
our  O
patients  O
generally  O
see  O

   
a  O
dentist  O
more  O
often  O
is  O
a  O
physician  O
well  O
our  O
patients  O
have  O
got  O
the  O
physician  O
to  O
get  O
told  O
they  O
need  O
to  O
see  O
the  O
dentist  O
or  O
how  O
you  O
see  O
this  O
of  O

   
working  O

   
also  O
good  O
questions  O
the  O
first  O
one  O
you  O
notice  O
i  B-MISC
only  O
showed  O
the  O
parts  O
was  O
a  O
decreased  O
risk  O
of  O
denture  O
is  O
a  O
longer  O
list  O

   
of  O
example  O
increased  O
risk  O
for  O
should  O
make  O
it  O
through  O
this  O
presentation  O
but  O
know  O
how  O
much  O
farther  O

   
but  O
the  O
question  O
that  O
to  O
provide  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
how  O
we  O
pay  O
for  O

   
this  O
health  O
care  O
within  O
dentistry  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
at  O
a  O
great  O
question  O
because  O
diagnostics  B-MISC
have  O
not  O
fared  O
well  O

   
in  O
dentistry  O
get  O
as  O
we  O
look  O
at  O
medical  O
model  O
surgical  O
model  O
because  O
we  O
really  O
are  O
still  O
overall  O
situated  O
and  O
very  O
much  O
of  O
a  O
restorative  O
type  O
of  O

   
modus  O
operandi  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
how  O
we  O
deliver  O
care  O
diagnostics  B-MISC
have  O
not  O
been  O
accepted  O
by  O
thirdparty  O
payers  O
at  O
this  O
point  O
overall  O
it's  O
the  O
biopsy  O
in  O
oral  O
pathology  O
but  O
beyond  O
that  O
is  O
a  O
challenge  O
because  O
even  O
if  O
you  O
look  O
at  O
that  O
personalized  O
medicine  O
study  O
were  O
doing  O
in  O
there  O
are  O
no  O
codes  O
that  O
we  O
have  O
in  O
dentistry  O
for  O
diagnosis  O
so  O
all  O
that  O
information  O
is  O
missing  O
and  O
so  O
we  O
need  O
to  O
begin  O
there  O
terms  O
of  O
valuing  O
a  O
diagnosis  O
and  O
capturing  O
that  O
information  O

   
and  O
then  O
you  O
know  O
incorporating  O
that  O
into  O
the  O
dental  O
office  O
know  O
how  O
we  O
do  O
that  O
doesn't  O
need  O
to  O
be  O
a  O
partnership  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
policy  O
making  O
because  O
the  O
professional  O
community  O
has  O
to  O
embrace  O
this  O
we  O
have  O
to  O
embrace  O
these  O
new  O
technologies  O

   
some  O
of  O
the  O
mouth  O
to  O
be  O
taken  O
with  O
a  O
grain  O
saw  O
but  O
in  O
how  O
we  O
pay  O
for  O
them  O
will  O
be  O
a  O
big  O
challenge  O
they  O
will  O
have  O
to  O
be  O
fairly  O
inexpensive  O
or  O
connected  O
directly  O
with  O
the  O
treatment  O
so  O
there  O
might  O
be  O
customized  O
treatments  O
where  O
there  O
as  O
a  O

   
if  O
going  O
to  O
receive  O
this  O
treatment  O
in  O
to  O
have  O
this  O
test  O
on  O
the  O
see  O
okay  O
what  O
dosing  O
what  O

   
what  O
type  O
of  O
material  O
may  O
be  O
that  O
you'll  O
receive  O
but  O
the  O
cost  O
structure  O
has  O
been  O
a  O
challenge  O
because  O
in  O
dentistry  O
we  O
give  O
away  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
our  O
exams  O
relative  O
to  O
treatments  O
right  O

   
diagnostic  O
visit  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
by  O
a  O
physician  O
is  O
much  O
higher  O
for  O
a  O
maybe  O
a  O
shorter  O
treatment  O
time  O
that  O
we  O
charge  O
so  O
there  O
are  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
issues  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
from  O
the  O
policy  O
side  O
that  O
you  O
bring  O
up  O
thick  O

   
and  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
the  O
doctor  O
roberts  B-MISC
will  O
touch  O
on  O
that  O
better  O
how  O
can  O
be  O

   
pressure  O
the  O
discussion  O

   
and  O
i  B-MISC
can  O
suggest  O
source  O
of  O
things  O
that  O
are  O
currently  O
available  O
in  O
this  O
least  O
the  O
state  O
of  O
michigan  B-MISC
regarding  O
reimbursement  O
if  O
your  O
licensed  O
practitioner  O

   
and  O
you  O
have  O
a  O
procedure  O
that  O
to  O
do  O
within  O
the  O
scope  O
of  O
your  O
licensure  O
there  O
is  O
no  O
limit  O
that  O
the  O
state  O
of  O
michigan  B-MISC
has  O
on  O
who  O
is  O
a  O
provider  O
can  O
receive  O
reimbursement  O

   
so  O
your  O
is  O
a  O
mechanism  O
for  O
dentist  O
to  O
collect  O
medical  O
reimbursement  O
monies  O
for  O
procedures  O
for  O
which  O
there  O
are  O
licensed  O
to  O
do  O
so  O
there  O
is  O
no  O
restriction  O
if  O
this  O
is  O
an  O
accepted  O
procedure  O
your  O
licensed  O
practitioner  O
is  O
covered  O
under  O
your  O
licensure  O

   
yeah  O
so  O
everything  O
that  O
i  B-MISC
i've  I-MISC
presented  O
right  O
now  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
these  O
diagnostics  B-MISC
we  O
haven't  O
had  O
them  O
approved  O
by  O
regulatory  O
agencies  O
is  O
that  O
part  O
of  O
your  O
question  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
the  O
approval  O
process  O

   
so  O
today  O
his  O
diet  O
these  O
saliva  O
based  O
diagnostics  B-MISC
are  O
not  O
approved  O
and  O
so  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
the  O
trajectory  O
to  O
have  O
these  O
presented  O
to  O
the  O
after  O
actually  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
more  O
of  O
a  O
straightforward  O

   
process  O
for  O
after  O
the  O
approval  O
there  O
have  O
been  O
a  O
few  O
diagnostic  O
test  O
approved  O
by  O
the  O
after  O

   
but  O
they're  O
no  O
longer  O
available  O
so  O
one  O
of  O
them  O
was  O
a  O
diagnostic  O
test  O
for  O
periodontal  O
disease  O
using  O
an  O
enzyme  O
called  O
elastase  O
there  O
was  O
another  O
one  O
using  O
an  O
enzyme  O
called  O
ast  B-MISC

   
aspartate  O
aminotransferase  O
those  O
two  O
enzymebased  O
tests  O
were  O
out  O
on  O
the  O
market  O
for  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
years  O
but  O
then  O

   
when  O
went  O
off  O
the  O
market  O
there  O
is  O
one  O
on  O
the  O
market  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
the  O
aisle  O
one  O
genetic  O
test  O
that  O
is  O
after  O
approved  O
and  O
that  O
is  O
available  O
and  O
so  O
that  O
is  O
available  O
also  O
didn't  O
show  O
there  O
say  O
microbial  O
test  O

   
that  O
looks  O
at  O
periodontal  O
pathogens  O
and  O
that  O
is  O
available  O
but  O
then  O
maybe  O
answering  O
your  O
question  O
more  O
directly  O
know  O
can  O
use  O
that  O
to  O
say  O
an  O
evidencebased  O
manner  O
you  O
should  O
treat  O
your  O
patients  O
based  O
off  O
of  O
this  O
it's  O
more  O
of  O

   
directional  O
information  O
on  O
the  O
parradile  O
pathogen  O
so  O
a  O
dna  B-MISC
probe  O
analysis  O
that's  O
used  O
in  O
combination  O
with  O
the  O
genetic  O
test  O

   
the  O
varied  O
x  B-MISC
corporation  O
does  O
have  O
an  O
appt  O
cam  O
test  O
that  O
is  O
recently  O
made  O
available  O
it's  O
licensed  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
if  O
the  O
approved  O
test  O
and  O
also  O
is  O
specific  O
for  O
particular  O
agent  O
so  O
the  O
direction  O
for  O
that  O
application  O
to  O
the  O
the  O
following  O
the  O

   
the  O
varied  O
exmodel  O
may  O
be  O
an  O
appropriate  O
approach  O
to  O

   
questions  O
first  O
say  O
very  O
low  O
risk  O
for  O
menopause  O

   
curious  O
about  O
composition  O
of  O
saliva  O
on  O
the  O
parotid  O
gland  O
versus  O
submandibular  O
versus  O
whole  O
saliva  O
that  O
spit  O
out  O
initially  O

   
that  O
change  O
these  O
diagnostic  O
tests  O
and  O
how  O
these  O
practitioners  O
supposed  O
to  O
manage  O
that  O
patients  O
with  O
stone  O

   
where  O
we  O
getting  O
as  O

   
we  O
state  O
that  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
change  O
understand  O
secreted  O
biomarkers  O
that  O
and  O
it's  O
like  O
if  O
you  O
patient  O
spit  O

   
other  O
secretions  O

   
compared  O
to  O
say  O
milking  O
the  O
parotid  O
duct  O
pure  O
form  O
is  O
test  O
that  O
so  O
that's  O
a  O
great  O
question  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O

   
the  O
sources  O
of  O
the  O
saliva  O
they're  O
used  O
some  O
people  O
have  O
looked  O
at  O
a  O
specific  O
glands  O
themselves  O
some  O
of  O
these  O
tests  O
are  O
being  O
called  O
saliva  O
diagnostics  B-MISC
are  O
basically  O
a  O
buccal  O
swab  O
that  O
was  O
being  O
used  O
for  O
the  O

   
the  O
interleukin  O
one  O
assessment  O
and  O
so  O
i  B-MISC
there  O
is  O
no  O
answer  O
to  O
that  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
what  O
is  O
the  O
best  O
biomarker  O
because  O
that  O
the  O
different  O
sources  O
for  O
example  O
the  O
periodontal  O
disease  O
using  O
a  O
parrot  O

   
a  O
protein  O
biomarker  O
you  O
want  O
that  O
you  O
see  O
are  O
that's  O
the  O
main  O
the  O
main  O
proteins  O
that  O
actually  O
appear  O
in  O
the  O
saliva  O
associate  O
with  O
inflammation  O
is  O
based  O
off  O
of  O
that  O
serum  O
ultra  O
filtrate  O
if  O
you  O
will  O
of  O
the  O
gingival  O
crevicular  O
fluid  O

   
a  O
larger  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
those  O
very  O
large  O
proteins  O
are  O
all  O
derived  O
from  O
the  O
gingival  O
crevicular  O
fluid  O
so  O
some  O
people  O
have  O
looked  O
at  O
separating  O
out  O
even  O
looking  O
at  O
stimulated  O
unstimulated  O
saliva  O

   
taking  O
from  O
the  O
parotid  O
duct  O
submandibular  O
and  O
it  O
depends  O
on  O
the  O
disease  O
and  O
what  O
you  O
use  O

   
i  O
think  O
what  O
has  O
happened  O
is  O
again  O
there's  O
been  O
this  O
thrust  O
to  O
develop  O
rapid  O
easy  O
to  O
use  O
types  O
of  O
diagnostic  O
so  O
that  O
twenty  O
three  O
and  O
may  O
test  O
is  O
really  O
one  O
that  O
looks  O

   
can  O
i  B-MISC
you  O
know  O
is  O
a  O
very  O
simple  O
collection  O
method  O
to  O
evaluate  O
and  O
so  O
for  O
dna  B-MISC
that  O
ends  O
up  O
being  O
a  O
very  O
good  O
method  O
just  O
whole  O
saliva  O
and  O
most  O
everything  O
i  B-MISC
showed  O
you  O
was  O
from  O
whole  O
saliva  O
versus  O
the  O
buccal  O
swab  O
you'll  O
get  O
more  O
of  O
a  O
cellular  O

   
type  O
of  O
collection  O
so  O
it's  O
it's  O
really  O
specific  O
but  O
it's  O
a  O
good  O
question  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
this  O
year  O
actually  O
has  O
put  O
together  O
a  O
working  O
group  O
to  O
actually  O
develop  O
standardized  O
methodologies  O
on  O
the  O
collections  O
of  O
all  O
these  O
types  O
of  O
fluids  O
i'm  B-MISC
participating  O
on  O
that  O
working  O
group  O

   
and  O
it's  O
it's  O
very  O
challenging  O
to  O
come  O
up  O
surface  O
pretty  O
standardized  O
you  O
see  O
everything  O

   
across  O
the  O
field  O
so  O
from  O
a  O
methodological  O
approach  O
is  O
it's  O
a  O
great  O
question  O
that  O
really  O
needs  O
to  O
be  O
sorted  O
out  O

   
thank  O
you  O
