@void
<Sync time="10.550"/>
 thanks everybody for coming
<Sync time="12.11"/>
 I just wanna say I've been coming to these things I think I missed the first one and it is my favorite place in the world to be and it's really because of you guys so let's give you guys a big hand
<Sync time="23.889"/>
@applause 
<Sync time="25.581"/>
 alright so we #* there's two of us talking so there's not a lot of time so we're gonna do like little Ted Talks hopefully mine doesn't turn into a Ted Geisel talk
<Sync time="37.031"/>
 for those of you know don't know who that is is doctor Seuss 
<Sync time="40.215"/>
 so okay first of all our friend Al Danenberg he been ill he would have loved to be here he can't make it 
<Sync time="50.535"/>
 so you know our hearts and prayers are are with him
<Sync time="55.124"/>
 I just wanted to start by saying you know he was kind of my inspiration for what I'm talking about today 
<Sync time="62.175"/>
 so currently were doing a study designed by doctor Al
<Sync time="66.652"/>
 its a we're gonna look for 50 subjects with measurable (gum disease)
<Sync time="76.114"/>
 we're going to do (swabs) actually (Mitoswabs) to check their (mitochondrial function) and oral (microbiome) swabs as well
<Sync time="86.606"/>
 6 weeks of either a (placebo) or a (probiotic) with (vitamin K2) double check the inflammation and also the mitocon- mitochondrial function and the oral (microbiome)
<Sync time="100.328"/>
 we suspect we're gonna see changes in the mitochondrial function 
<Sync time="106.530"/>
 and the oral microbiome is probably going to change because we're affecting the (GI microbiome) so that's sort of the incentive for what I'm gonna talk about today
<Sync time="117.764"/>
 alright that's my fake book I haven't written that carb mouth maybe one day 
<Sync time="124.470"/>
 so the two things that I'm gonna talk about today we're gonna do an examination of the relationship between the oral and general (gut dysbiosis) both of which seemed to be initiated by the introduction of (dense acellular carbohydrates) 
<Sync time="142.020"/>
 and then I'm gonna get into an explora- an exploration of some of the critical factors in the (etiology) of (caries) and (periodontitis) 
<Sync time="151.020"/>
 okay so 23 centuries ago Aristotle tried to describe foods that caused cavities
<Sync time="159.526"/>
 and then you look down at the guy in the bottom and that's about where we've gotten
<Sync time="163.631"/>
 it's still very very confusing 
<Sync time="166.470"/>
 here is an example if you look at the foods on the right you know which one of those is actually gonna cause more cavities 
<Sync time="175.155"/>
 is it the lollipop with all the sugar or is it the pretzel
<Sync time="179.92"/>
 and there are factors that I would say both cause cavities but one might be worse than the other and it's kind of a mystery
<Sync time="189.158"/>
 and we'll get into that a little bit later
<Sync time="191.604"/>
 so here's the general formula okay
<Sync time="195.034"/>
 we have (fermentable carbohydrates) plus (cariogenic) (mouth bacteria) so cariogenic just means cavity causing and susceptible teeth and then that gets you your risk for cavities
<Sync time="206.581"/>
 that's really a bit of an oversimplification so throughout this little presentation I'm gonna be clarifying that 
<Sync time="213.615"/>
 okay so this is where we're gonna end up with I'm not gonna keep the slide up there for too long and come back to it reconstruct it later on 
<Sync time="222.075"/>
 alright so fermentable carbohydrates
<Sync time="225.858"/>
 all carbohydrates are fermentable okay
<Sync time="231.763"/>
 they can all be (metabolized) for energy by (microorganisms)
<Sync time="236.327"/>
 so we've been on this planet for 3 million years or so
<Sync time="242.179"/>
 we've only just recently gotten cavities and we've been eating fermentable carbohydrates for a long time so that's incorrect 
<Sync time="254.925"/>
 okay (whole foods) it's interesting that have a picture of of an (acorn) 
<Sync time="266.085"/>
 you don't think of people as eating acorns but we see squirrels eating them all the time
<Sync time="271.086"/>
 and if you look at that thing there's a lot of wood in there as they got to get through the wood in order to get to the carbohydrate inside 
<Sync time="278.610"/>
 so arguably a diet that's a whole foods diet it's gonna be much better for you
<Sync time="287.012"/>
 and I have a study down there that if you're kind of curious I have it
<Sync time="291.233"/>
 you can refer to that or you can read this book Tyron finds corn in his #* 
<Sync time="298.785"/>
 that's pretty good explanation right there
<Sync time="302.017"/>
 you wrap stuff up in cellulose it's hard to break down we don't get a sugar bomb in our mouth
<Sync time="308.530"/>
 okay so (dense acellular carbohydrate) right this is what we're looking at sugar all that sort of stuff by studying how (ultra-processing) changes the properties of (whole foods) and how these foods affect the (gut microbiome) more useful dietary guidelines can be made 
<Sync time="328.140"/>
 and for those of you who don't know what dense acellular carbohydrates are there's some of them
<Sync time="334.486"/>
 doesn't have to just be wheat flour could be (tapioca starch)
<Sync time="338.69"/>
 anytime you take the (carbs) outside of a (plant cell) it's a dangerous thing
<Sync time="345.323"/>
 okay so (plaque) acid dense acellular carbohydrate and (tooth decay) 
<Sync time="353.145"/>
 the mechanism is is this you get the acellular carbohydrates in the mouth
<Sync time="359.846"/>
 the bacteria in the mouth ferment the stuff
<Sync time="362.81"/>
 it lowers the (pH) and the pH dissolves the minerals in the teeth it's that simple
<Sync time="368.905"/>
 @void
<Sync time="373.114"/>
 and when we're talking about gum disease you have plaque making (lipopolysaccharides) from the dense acellular carbohydrates and you get gum disease 
<Sync time="384.600"/>
 lipopolysaccharides are also known as (endotoxins) okay so on a local level they're toxic to the gums 
<Sync time="392.880"/>
 and this is with the introduction of dense acellular carbohydrates
<Sync time="397.395"/>
 endotoxins 
<Sync time="402.857"/>
 okay so humans are quite unique (primates) and (lagomorphs) those those are like (hares) and rabbits do have (salivary amylase) but humans have multiple copies
<Sync time="415.19"/>
 okay some people have I think 2 copies and I think you can have up to about 15 
<Sync time="420.660"/>
 so when you're eating that pretzel okay we've all done this you can't touch your teeth together for for sometimes 20 minutes to 1 hour because there's there's all that doughy stuff stuck to your teeth and I think the the (starch) and flowers (amylopectin) if I'm not mistaken and that's considered to be a lower (cariogenetic) substance however it stays there for a long time and now your saliva and especially if you have more (amylase) you used to call it (ptyalin) you're gonna be breaking that stuff down into simple sugars
<Sync time="457.587"/>
 so what's worse a lollipop that maybe sticks to your teeth but it melts off pretty quickly or maybe a pretzel that stays there for a long time these are interesting questions 
<Sync time="471.435"/>
 so more amylase does equal more sugar okay we've #* Scott touched upon that
<Sync time="479.751"/>
 so basically you know (salivary amylase) becomes a problem when we eat that (processed carbohydrates)
<Sync time="490.417"/>
 so even if they're (complex carbohydrates) they can become (simple sugars) in the mouth
<Sync time="495.434"/>
 the bacteria can actually hijack the amylase to help to get more sugar from the starch 
<Sync time="501.150"/>
 and they also use it sort of as a matrix to develop the (biofilm)
<Sync time="506.413"/>
 and and also the bacteria do make their own amylase as well
<Sync time="511.282"/>
 so all of this stuff causes a (lowering of the pH) an (acidic environment) and basically melting away of the teeth 
<Sync time="520.620"/>
 okay so Weston A. Price okay John Yudkin Thomas L. Cleave these are all sort of pioneers that spoke about the introduction of modern foods and you know what it did to all of us so you know you see that guy on the bottom there with all of his tattoos but if he didn't have his tattoos his fleshiness is giving away what really what he's doing isn't it
<Sync time="548.934"/>
@void 
<Sync time="556.478"/>
 that's another way of putting it Forrest Gump was pretty smart 
<Sync time="560.190"/>
 but to get technical and there is a lot of mechanisms that go on this just happens to be one
<Sync time="567.99"/>
 so basically De Lartigue was a bit of more elaborate in in implicating the (vagus nerve) (leptin resistance) (blunting) you know the (satiety) and they're a lot of mechanisms and we just I don't have enough time to really get into that today okay 
<Sync time="590.686"/>
 so the present hypothesis suggests that it is a diet of (high density carbohydrates) that produce inflammatory microbiotal changes in both the mouth and the gut 
<Sync time="604.455"/>
 when I was putting together this presentation I was maybe put a picture of the gut 
<Sync time="611.010"/>
 and it's interesting half of the pictures you pull up start here they don't include the mouth and it's amazing to me
<Sync time="620.735"/>
 we already talked about salivary amylase or breaking down carbohydrates in the mouth we're digesting right here okay 
<Sync time="629.636"/>
 so when you start with this dysbiosis of the mouth with the introduction of dense acellular carbohydrates you're gonna get inflammation of the gums you're gonna get your teeth melting away
<Sync time="641.306"/>
 what happens to the food after you swallow it
<Sync time="644.003"/>
 last time I checked it goes down somewhere and it stays in your body for a long time 
<Sync time="649.065"/>
 so there is a definite change in the (microbiome) of the gut
<Sync time="655.591"/>
 some people argue the gut microbiome changes first some people argue the mouth microbiome changes first chicken or the egg I don't know to me it doesn't really seem that important
<Sync time="669.497"/>
 but to me when you introduce this dysbiosis to your mouth rest assured excuse me it's in your gut and this little diagram I had to pencil in the gum disease it wasn't even on there people just seem to forget about the mouth
<Sync time="687.048"/>
 but all of these things occur these are low levels of chronic inflammation that we have in our bodies because of dense acellular carbohydrate changing microbiome 
<Sync time="702.240"/>
 okay so here we go dysbiosis of the gut pretty much means dysbiosis of the (oral cavity)
<Sync time="710.367"/>
 the present hypothesis suggests that in parallel with bacterial effects of sugars on (dental and periodontal health) acellular flowers sugars and processed foods produce an inflammatory microbiota via the (upper gastrointestinal tract) 
<Sync time="725.685"/>
 that was said by our friend doctor Ian Spreadbury maybe 3 or 4 years ago I don't know if any of you guys saw that lecture go back to it it's worth watching 
<Sync time="735.090"/>
 it's on YouTube I believe
<Sync time="738.506"/>
 okay so now I'm gonna go through a couple of studies and there's really not a lot of research out there and it's really kind of all over the place 
<Sync time="750.610"/>
 I'm gonna go through a few studies that are gonna connect the oral (oral microbiome) with gut dysbiosis
<Sync time="758.786"/>
 so in this study here they did a bacterial analysis of obese women and 98 point 4 percent of them this the oral microbiome ha- just the presence of one bacteria at levels greater than 1 point 05 percent of the total (bacterial colony) was indicative of obesity
<Sync time="786.878"/>
 so I mean that's close to a 100 percent
<Sync time="789.38"/>
 they could find one (germ) in the mouth and predict whether the person was obese so that's pretty good 
<Sync time="794.520"/>
 and I think more research needs to be done excuse me along these lines 
<Sync time="800.250"/>
 we may be able to determine a lot of things just by a simple (oral swab) it's really easy to do 
<Sync time="809.249"/>
 you know an (oral microbiome swab) test it's a heck of a lot easier than a (stool test) I assure you anybody here ever do a stool test 
<Sync time="818.760"/>
 not so much fun 
<Sync time="822.641"/>
 okay two more studies 
<Sync time="825.566"/>
 results find that oral (buccal) so that's the cheek microbiome reflects differences in the microbial ecology of participants with (IBS) that are overweight 
<Sync time="836.070"/>
 okay so they could find patterns of overweight people with IBS in the mouth 
<Sync time="843.000"/>
 the second one the one in the bottom there 
<Sync time="846.405"/>
 mounting evidence supports a major role of the systemic spread of oral (commensals) and (pathogens) to distant body sites causing extra-oral infections and inflammation 
<Sync time="856.890"/>
 what does that mean
<Sync time="858.393"/>
so the the (germs) in the mouth are getting into the body so you know we're led to believe that the (stomach acid) is supposed to be high enough to kill all of the germs 
<Sync time="870.790"/>
 maybe maybe not
<Sync time="872.496"/>
 I think that s- excuse me some of them do get through
<Sync time="877.264"/>
 but there are other ways that these (critters) can get through 
<Sync time="881.040"/>
 if you've ever seen severe gum disease the the the gums are just bloody and not looking too good
<Sync time="889.291"/>
 so really what you have from this oral dysbiosis is is a leaky mouth okay
<Sync time="895.905"/>
 so that's a way that the (lipopolysaccharides) by the way are gonna get into the (bloodstream) right from the mouth 
<Sync time="901.860"/>
 and now you got low levels of (chronic inflammation) throughout the body
<Sync time="906.263"/>
 and you're sick 
<Sync time="910.609"/>
 I think I've got 1 or 2 more 
<Sync time="914.298"/>
 okay so this was in pediatric (Crohn's disease) patients and this one it was a little bit more general they just found that there was a decrease in the diversity of the oral microbiome in this particular patients
<Sync time="931.354"/>
 and then one more in mice 
<Sync time="933.866"/>
 they observed that mice that had (colitis) I think they induced it the composition of the bacteria present in the oral cavity and saliva changed as well
<Sync time="952.321"/>
 okay so we're we're seeing a pattern here where we can see changes in the bacteria of the mouth as they pertain to disease states so I think there's a lot of work that needs to be done here but this is really really really promising 
<Sync time="968.250"/>
 so this is kind of my little pipe dream 
<Sync time="972.186"/>
 you know for oral microbia- microbial analysis
<Sync time="975.905"/>
 could it be a proxy for a (stool test)
<Sync time="978.272"/>
 wouldn't that be nice 
<Sync time="979.965"/>
 a proxy to determine whether you have other systemic diseases
<Sync time="985.136"/>
 early detection of gut dysbiosis before it happens
<Sync time="989.563"/>
 and of course maybe even if we find a couple of (germs) in there maybe it's gonna determine that you have some kind of (gum disease) or (cavity) if you don't watch out
<Sync time="999.962"/>
 so that's pretty cool stuff
<Sync time="1001.396"/>
 @void
<Sync time="1005.365"/>
 love Yoda
<Sync time="1007.395"/>
 okay so back to my formula 
<Sync time="1011.577"/>
 so we went over (fermentable carbohydrates) it's really dense acellular carbohydrates in my opinion excuse me
<Sync time="1021.470"/>
 so the (cariogenic mouth bacteria) 
<Sync time="1024.695"/>
 I also have a problem with that because we all have (cariogenic bacteria) in our mouths right now 
<Sync time="1033.824"/>
 but we all aren't getting cavities right now so that's a little bit incorrect 
<Sync time="1039.096"/>
 and and here is a little proof so you cannot inherit cavity causing germs from your parents
<Sync time="1047.623"/>
 we know this this has been discussed a thousand times at the AHS over the years 
<Sync time="1052.895"/>
 that you know when you go through the (birth canal) you get inundated with your mom's germs
<Sync time="1059.626"/>
 so yeah most of us get our oral microbiome from our mothers and fathers but they can have mouths riddled with tooth decay and that's not necessarily what happens with the kids okay 
<Sync time="1072.423"/>
 so they did a (twin study) here and what they really determined it's it's the oral environment later on okay
<Sync time="1080.234"/>
 so germs become (cariogenic) cavity causing because you change their environment which changes their behavior
<Sync time="1089.915"/>
 the analogy that I like to use is you know we all have probably a good friend or two they're as nice as p- excuse me as nice as pie and then they get a couple of drinks and in a minute get real angry right
<Sync time="1103.498"/>
 so yeah give them the wrong substrate and their behavior changed 
<Sync time="1109.595"/>
 and then you know as pertains to gum disease 
<Sync time="1114.335"/>
 I'm gonna get a little more involved with this in a minute but none of our paleolithic ancestors had tooth decay or gum disease we know this because there are thousands and thousands of fossilized skulls that we have available and I think Kevin is gonna be probably talk more about that later 
<Sync time="1131.555"/>
 but we can study (tartar) and (plaque) that's thousands of years old (paleo-microbiology) it's kind of a cool thing
<Sync time="1140.956"/>
 they can actually go in there and and look at the (DNA) and and figure out what the (bacterial colonies) we had in our mouths years and years and years ago 
<Sync time="1153.830"/>
 so they found two changes
<Sync time="1159.67"/>
 the first one was ten thousand years ago when we started farming and that's some pretty good dentistry over there for however many thousands of years ago that would be considered (prosthetic dentistry) for its day it's pretty good
<Sync time="1172.23"/>
 but when we started taking carbohydrates out of the cell that's what we did when we started farming we introduced the dense acellular carbohydrates into our bodies 
<Sync time="1184.745"/>
 and this is the result
<Sync time="1186.36"/>
 so what they saw was that there was an uptick of (strep mutants) that's one that c- that creates a lot of acid 
<Sync time="1195.365"/>
 the second change was during the Industrial Revolution because we further processed flowers and we added sugars 
<Sync time="1202.805"/>
 and you know this is one of the sufferers he had to get one tooth and and his dentures were not wooden by the way 
<Sync time="1211.055"/>
 okay I got to rush I have one minute left okay (susceptible teeth)
<Sync time="1215.384"/>
 we all have susceptible teeth anybody can get a (cavity) anywhere anyhow 
<Sync time="1219.890"/>
 yes some people do have stronger teeth than others but it was never a factor in the Paleolithic era
<Sync time="1226.155"/>
 our teeth are plenty strong enough if we don't put this stuff in our bodies okay couple other things 
<Sync time="1233.555"/>
 frequency how often this stuff gets in the mouth is very important
<Sync time="1240.894"/>
 frequency and sequence so (baby bottle decay) everybody know what that is
<Sync time="1245.387"/>
 you can take very watered-down juice or even milk and (lactose) is actually very low on the (cariogenic scale)
<Sync time="1253.951"/>
 but if the baby is suckling that thing all night long within weeks there will be no teeth left
<Sync time="1260.863"/>
 it's it's unbelievable 
<Sync time="1263.390"/>
 okay and then retention we talk a little bit about that before when stuff sticks to your teeth 
<Sync time="1269.555"/>
 it's able to be broken down by our (salivary amylase) and also it's just there as a substrate for the bacteria in the mouth to do their dirty work okay
<Sync time="1283.424"/>
 before when I showed you other different things ranging from candies I don't know bagels and pretzels
<Sync time="1289.166"/>
 that's been looked at and what they've really determined is that consumers you know we really can't figure out which one is worse
<Sync time="1298.797"/>
 is it the lollipop it's it's just it's it's a little too confusing but Joe Pesci put it better 
<Sync time="1308.175"/>
 all right the acorn got to get to the acorn
<Sync time="1310.487"/>
 there were people fifteen thousand years ago that were in Morocco northern Morocco and they were eating acorns 
<Sync time="1318.680"/>
 and that's the teeth they got from it
<Sync time="1321.276"/>
 they weren't using sugar
<Sync time="1323.224"/>
 they figured out a way with stone tools I guess to (refine) the carbohydrates from acorns into acellular dense acellular carbohydrates and that's the result 
<Sync time="1336.980"/>
 not too good
<Sync time="1338.272"/>
 so the paleo diet you know paleo cookies no no 
<Sync time="1343.287"/>
 okay real quick I got to go through this my time is up
<Sync time="1346.743"/>
 this is the real formula dense acellular carbohydrate any oral microbiome we all have one you can not have one that's all you need you need teeth anybody here no teeth you're in the wrong r- lecture room
<Sync time="1362.030"/>
 the food has to be retained on the teeth for a time because (brushing) and (flossing) works that's why we recommend it
<Sync time="1367.780"/>
 the frequency we went over that and I don't have time to get into it but the quality of your (saliva) and your (salivary flow) is very very important
<Sync time="1377.99"/>
 this is my future bestseller we got wheat belly and grain brain why not carb mouth that's really what it is if I had to simplify it I my time is brief you can I'll be happy to send these slides to you that's my email address that's my website I usually put up a blog once a week thank you
<Sync time="1397.897"/>
@applause
<Sync time="1404.940"/>
 okay John Lennon my favorite Beatle 
<Sync time="1408.630"/>
 this is our second annual I'm I'm and Kevin Boyd by the way
<Sync time="1413.307"/>
 (pediatric dentist) and a wannabe anthropologist not not quite yet there but in training 
<Sync time="1420.275"/>
 this is the second time we've done this last last year was sort of a hiatus and this year we're resuming it we don't have one of our founding members Alvin
<Sync time="1429.359"/>
 however he will be saying a few words to you in a minute but this is some his contributions to dentistry and to the (paleo healthcare movement) 
<Sync time="1444.500"/>
 It's Al Danenberg I wish I were there in person I'm here in video I'm here in spirit but unfortunately not in person
<Sync time="1453.503"/>
 I have some medical issues that #are preventing me from# traveling 
<Sync time="1458.540"/>
 but I wanted to say a couple things 
<Sync time="1461.792"/>
 2 years ago the 2 docs and myself were part of the first dental panel that was presented at the Ancestral Health Symposium and it was awesome
<Sync time="1474.052"/>
 the audience loved it we had great questions and I'm sure this one is going to be even better
<Sync time="1480.735"/>
 the most important thing today I think is that there's so much research that's going on with the (gut microbiome) the (oral health) and overall (chronic disease) and it's so intricately and intimately related 
<Sync time="1496.655"/>
 dentistry it's just the perfect profession to speak of these matters because who's the physician of the mouth dentists are
<Sync time="1506.779"/>
 so if we can get the word out and p- and people understand how important the gut is to the mouth which is so critical to the rest of the body we are in great shape and we're making a real dent in the medical profession
<Sync time="1523.356"/>
 have a great seminar I know you guys are gonna do a wonderful job
<Sync time="1526.735"/>
 let me know how things go I am excited for you and I wish I were there but have a great one let me know take care 
<Sync time="1534.66"/>
@applause
<Sync time="1536.219"/>
 that's great so you know everybody here is so inspired
<Sync time="1541.104"/>
 send him you know a note saying how you're glad to hear from him and we're gonna try to beam him in next year and just encourage him 
<Sync time="1550.805"/>
 you might you might actually help increase the quality and quantity of his life
<Sync time="1555.15"/>
 this group means so much to him so glad we could do that it was nice that it turned out great
<Sync time="1561.337"/>
 you just gave me that well okay that isn't working so let's try that 
<Sync time="1565.865"/>
 last year I did a similar thing 2 years ago and and Scott and Alvin that and I talked about the shrinking face and I wasn't quite as much as far I am in my research as I am now is that what affects the face affects the (airway) 
<Sync time="1583.940"/>
 and I'm gonna develop that concept a little bit
<Sync time="1587.074"/>
 shortly after that Montana meeting last year I went to Salt Lake City and spoke at the International Society of Evolution Medicine and Public Health and developed this whole concept from them after this meeting 2 years ago so I this this group means a lot to me every time I come here just through networking and and speaking and the questions that it really helps me advance my own curiosity and things that I can contribute to the science at least in this lecture circuit
<Sync time="1618.151"/>
 this is something that I took out in the lobby in Bozeman Montana 
<Sync time="1625.370"/>
 and that guess what is a habitual (nose breather) probably from birth and probably while mom was carrying this woman and man when they were babies
<Sync time="1637.62"/>
 they also the mothers probably were nose breathers because we found out that just like the flight attendant says put the mask on yourself before you help your kid 
<Sync time="1647.540"/>
 the placenta is very selective for oxygen mom gets priority it's the only (nutrient) that mothers get priority for
<Sync time="1655.056"/>
'cause if a mom dies the baby dies so babies throughout our whole 300000 years of anatomically modern human history have learned in utero to to not only survive with low or to relative to you know what we get when we're in the outside world 
<Sync time="1671.525"/>
 but the the (PO2) (in utero) is actually thinner than the air on top of Mount Everest and actually a mile above Mount Everest and that that's a study that was done in the 18 hundreds by Sir Barcroft in England
<Sync time="1685.610"/>
 why is this important why am I so intrigued about this Michael Mew is Marianna Evans is and there's several people that are really pursuing this because it not only makes a difference in how we look 
<Sync time="1699.710"/>
 but it makes a difference in how the brain grows and what we commonly call (Attention Deficit Disorder) often is these kids early on before maybe they're diagnosed they have (co-morbid malocclusion) that can preclude them breathing habitually through their nose 
<Sync time="1716.960"/>
 so that's kind of the basis of the thesis that I'm working on
<Sync time="1721.723"/>
I'm a (visiting scholar) at Penn and I'm also now an (assistant professor) of anthropology at the University of Arkansas under Jerry Rose mentoring a PhD student who wants to she's been time at my office looking at my data on how I clinically apply anthropological theories to (clinical practice) 
<Sync time="1742.160"/>
 and also that's what we are doing at the University of Pennsylvania so as last year we we were 2 years ago we had Steven #* who helped us moderate and Brett is helping and we've got all kind of help today that I didn't wasn't aware of so thank you all for for all the support
<Sync time="1764.218"/>
 next month in Boston I'll be speaking at the Oral Medicine Tactic- Toxicology group which is you know I can't even pronounce it I'm substituting for Michael Gelb 'cause he couldn't come and this is where I was looking at Scott's Vitae and you know he's really involved with functional medicine so this is an area where I'd have been developing this lecture for them
<Sync time="1790.855"/>
 and I adapted it for today's talk so instead of assessing (pre-apnea) in the (pediatric dental patient) you know and then what do with it clinically I'm just gonna talk about (pediatric sleep apnea) sort of as a Western disease a (non-communicable disease) that is coe- seems to coexist with cultural industrialization
<Sync time="1813.116"/>
 this is what I'm gonna tell you for 20 minutes 
<Sync time="1816.905"/>
 that (jaws) and faces are intimately connected to the (airway) and that (orthotropics) (orthodontics) (dentofacial orthopedics) it's the ortho that Latin or Greek for correct 
<Sync time="1831.545"/>
 John who is one who really turned me onto this about 20 years ago or 15 years ago 
<Sync time="1838.175"/>
 and actually got me access to the Roman (skulls) at the British museum that he had access to and he developed and Mike you can fill in the blanks on that of when he actually developed this in the fifties and sixties but I was there really to look at the same Roman skulls
<Sync time="1853.971"/>
 and have since looked at thousands of other skulls and and pretty much provided a lot of support for his orthotropic hypothesis 
<Sync time="1862.880"/>
 one of the things I found is that it works in kids while they still have their baby teeth 2 to six year-olds and I found literature from medical and dental literature from over a 100 years ago that seemed to validate this protocol that that we use in Chicago and elsewhere 
<Sync time="1879.890"/>
 (observational studies) again as opposed to (random controlled trials) don't pooh-pooh at observational studies oh show me the random controlled trials bullshit 
<Sync time="1890.195"/>
 you know you need observational studies before you can run random controlled trials
<Sync time="1894.627"/>
 how do you think they discovered you should wash your hands before you deliver babies
<Sync time="1898.676"/>
 how do you think Einstein you know came up the theory of relativity
<Sync time="1902.744"/>
 these were all observations the Broad Street pump and cholera in England it was observations that led to major breakthroughs (penicillin) observational studies what drove these major breakthroughs in medicine and and humanity
<Sync time="1919.127"/>
 here's a paper from 1912 the (relief) of (nasal obstruction) by orthodontia a plea for early recognition and correction of faulty (maxillary development) 
<Sync time="1928.055"/>
 do you know many papers I have like this that go back to the late 19 century
<Sync time="1932.749"/>
 all the way up through about World War Two something happened in World War Two
<Sync time="1937.44"/>
 and anthropologists have come up with really good speculations as to what happened which we can go into in Q &amp; A if you want
<Sync time="1944.460"/>
 the back of the face is the airway the front of the airway is the face
<Sync time="1949.222"/>
 okay jaws and faces are intimately connected the (craniofacial complex) the (respiratory system) okay
<Sync time="1957.362"/>
 and that's what we now call the (craniofacial respiratory complex) Michael Mew was the first to publish on (craniofacial dystrophy)
<Sync time="1966.644"/>
 I have suggested that if there's craniofacial dystrophy there's often (co-morbid) (respiratory dystrophy)
<Sync time="1974.386"/>
 so I would like you know and this we've got this in 3 textbooks now that have recently put chapters on what's called the (craniofacial respiratory complex) 
<Sync time="1985.505"/>
 this is from 1922 30 months of age being considered the most favorable time to begin expansion of children 
<Sync time="1995.360"/>
 I mean you are you are considered a heretic if you want to treat kids before the age of seven which is the American Association of Orthodontists says that is the age when children should shist- sh- first be observed observed for their first orthodontic evaluation
<Sync time="2013.158"/>
 but usually not treated till between 11 and 13
<Sync time="2016.383"/>
 that's what's common in the Western world right now England and in America especially
<Sync time="2021.412"/>
 I am really trying to persuade and be diplomatic
<Sync time="2025.859"/>
 I've now got the editor-in-chief of the American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics engaged on a in a dialogue and that is not a not a debate it's a dialogue
<Sync time="2038.365"/>
 and he is responding to what I'm saying that that age should be way before 7
<Sync time="2044.127"/>
 7 years old is a geriatric patient in my pediatric practice
<Sync time="2047.913"/>
 I've got kids coming from all over the country just like Mike's got people coming to him from all over the world that are seeking this treatment because conventional thought just do not do that yet
<Sync time="2060.171"/>
 this is a 2 year-old this is a John Mew's design of a stage one (bio-block appliance) 
<Sync time="2067.550"/>
 I use this on kids you know if they got 20 teeth I'm gonna start expanding them
<Sync time="2071.915"/>
 both parents have to be on board if one parent is negative I'm not gonna treat I refuse
<Sync time="2078.37"/>
 both parents have to understand and at least be neutral to positive that this is in the best long term health interest of their kids and it is validated by a 100 years of observational studies 
<Sync time="2090.235"/>
 normal does not mean healthy
<Sync time="2093.183"/>
 normal (blood pressure) 1 20 over 80 right
<Sync time="2095.945"/>
 for whom a given population average amongst Americans by the American Heart Association 
<Sync time="2101.940"/>
 how about these guys
<Sync time="2103.091"/>
 look at the differences there
<Sync time="2104.616"/>
 that's probably (genomic) that we all descend from this group this is the Khoisan in in Africa we we shared 99 point 9 percent if not more of their (genome)
<Sync time="2115.629"/>
 everybody who got out of Africa about 70000 years ago descended from this tribe 
<Sync time="2120.805"/>
 Spencer Wells and the Genografic Project watch that video it's incredible and he talks about this
<Sync time="2127.271"/>
 what does normal mean in terms of (occlusion)
<Sync time="2130.18"/>
 these are from orthodontic journals guess what this studied to determine what was normal 
<Sync time="2135.115"/>
 anthropological specimens a predated industry
<Sync time="2138.203"/>
 okay this used to be part of dental education
<Sync time="2141.606"/>
 the University of Virginia's medical school in the twenties required third year third year medical students to take a course in orthodontics because of the commonly understood connection between respiratory health and occlusion
<Sync time="2157.221"/>
 so all of these (erupted) (third molars) ahead of you know the (condyles) here 
<Sync time="2163.166"/>
 I don't know if this works
<Sync time="2164.21"/>
 well you can see this is the (ramus) and the (wisdom teeth) are always ahead of it in (lateral view) 
<Sync time="2169.870"/>
 you don't even get wisdom teeth anymore
<Sync time="2171.932"/>
 so I'm just gonna plaster these but the the orthodontic medical literature is loaded with (specimens) that inform clinicians during their training that come from pre-industrialized museum specimen 
<Sync time="2186.700"/>
 when this when this problem start
<Sync time="2189.38"/>
 (ontogeny) the development of the individual from (conception) to death
<Sync time="2194.065"/>
 (phylogeny) the that is the development of our (species)
<Sync time="2198.489"/>
 when did (malocclusion) first enter our species and one when does it usually enter in from an (ontological) perspective perhaps in utero
<Sync time="2208.901"/>
 these are fetal skulls from 4 5 100 years ago in of (stillborn fetuses) that didn't make it or or (infants)
<Sync time="2217.832"/>
 they all look like John Mew #* orthotropic #sounding
<Sync time="2220.889"/>
 they all and if you look at an (ultrasound) of any of you who have children if you look at your (mid-gestational) ultrasounds 
<Sync time="2227.380"/>
 you'll very felt- seldom find a chin that sits right underneath the (maxilla)
<Sync time="2231.437"/>
 so that's you know from an ontogeny perspective
<Sync time="2235.084"/>
 and this is actually a kid I'm treating
<Sync time="2236.946"/>
 the mother brought and she was I was treating for her one of her kids and she shows me an ultrasound and said it looks like I am making you another patient and it's like I wonder if there's a connection
<Sync time="2247.466"/>
 all that was 7 years ago and we've since accumulated maybe 200 mid-gestational ultrasounds of kids that I'm treating for retrognathia
<Sync time="2256.821"/>
 and there does seem to be a connection but it's seen that's observational it's not scientific yet so I'm not making any proclamations on any #* hundred
<Sync time="2266.964"/>
 these are things that we so we understood the nature of (respiration) and (failure to thrive) or or (intrauterine growth restriction)
<Sync time="2276.421"/>
 look at this and that what this says is people are always telling me that (smoking) causes (low birth weight) 
<Sync time="2283.150"/>
 talk about a win win win
<Sync time="2285.732"/>
 you know easy labor slim baby full flavor of Winston
<Sync time="2290.017"/>
 so it this is a oh my God you should hear the interviews with these and these who work for the tobacco lobby 
<Sync time="2296.125"/>
 and it's like some women wanna have small babies
<Sync time="2299.201"/>
 so anyway (phylogeny) is when it enters
<Sync time="2303.147"/>
 now I imagine several hands will go up knowing the right answer to this but when I give this to physicians and dentists I very seldom get one hand coming up and it's usually not right
<Sync time="2316.512"/>
 so this is something that needs to be incorporated into grade school how about it
<Sync time="2322.978"/>
 so it looks like I got minutes
<Sync time="2325.213"/>
 that so I'm really move through this
<Sync time="2328.272"/>
 the the jaws and faces got narrower they got (retrusive) and they got longer 
<Sync time="2334.540"/>
 the last major milestone in the 7 million years of (hominid) evolution is the emergence of modern humans or (homo sapiens)
<Sync time="2342.825"/>
 people who for the first time fundamentally looked and behaved like us
<Sync time="2347.895"/>
 while a date of around 200000 years ago was frequently given for this dynamic there are still substantial debate regarding the timing as something that was an ongoing process rather than a single point in geological time 
<Sync time="2360.670"/>
 anatomically it is widely recognized that facial size reduction or (gracilization) or feminization as it is sometimes called
<Sync time="2368.94"/>
 as well as (facial retraction) are key to finding traits for our species 
<Sync time="2373.465"/>
 so anyway I found literature a cause for lessened (prognathism) from the orthodontic literature from 1881
<Sync time="2382.053"/>
okay so this was understood as long ago as that that our faces but I think the (retraction) was just something that was academically interesting the people they didn't understand the connection or at least on a broad scale of its relationship to malocclusion and airway 
<Sync time="2401.803"/>
 so you know I'm saying that is you know (breastfeeding) has a lot to do with an ancestral patterns of (nursing) and (weaning)
<Sync time="2408.518"/>
 but also papoosing look at that kid in the papoose the posture of that head and neck
<Sync time="2414.606"/>
 so it wasn't just the nursing and weaning but it was also things like that
<Sync time="2418.639"/>
 and also the the type of pressure that is exerted by click talking which is what a lot of African and the people that were related to do that's kind all kinds of pressure early in life
<Sync time="2432.569"/>
 this is one of our ancestral museum skulls and you can look at the difference of that position
<Sync time="2438.641"/>
 signs of mouth breathing the chin recedes mothers will accuse children of inattention they didn't call it ADD but this is from I don't know yeah 1908 look at this
<Sync time="2450.537"/>
 so I'm gonna buzz these are just some cases
<Sync time="2453.545"/>
 you could see that you know that the airway is (retrusive) it's black and narrow like that that means that kid has a very narrow and poorly shaped airway when you bring the chin forward you open up the airway 
<Sync time="2466.285"/>
 we don't just look at physical signs but behavioral
<Sync time="2468.985"/>
 on the top those are all those yeses are behaviors that track with risk for (sleep apnea) and sleep apnea is a pre- predisposition to ADD
<Sync time="2477.338"/>
 and they all come back no so now orthodontic criteria success criteria is not just physical changes but (behavioral) changes 
<Sync time="2486.000"/>
 I'm just you know how much time do I have
<Sync time="2490.395"/>
not much
<Sync time="2491.756"/>
okay three minutes
<Sync time="2493.15"/>
 we've also discovered an algorithm from about 30 years of research at Harvard and elsewhere where if you know a child should have space for a nickel between each baby tooth 
<Sync time="2504.940"/>
 that means there's room for the tongue
<Sync time="2506.817"/>
 so when we see no space between (baby teeth) we know there is no room for the tongue
<Sync time="2511.351"/>
 for no other reason not to (straighten) them they don't they don't even have to be (crooked) but we expand these kids and we give them tongue space 
<Sync time="2519.040"/>
 that is really the killer argument for this
<Sync time="2521.82"/>
 and when you show parents and what happens when you make room for the tongue and what what happens to the airway is very it does no harm 
<Sync time="2531.490"/>
 it does no harm
<Sync time="2532.817"/>
 it can help them solve it if they need more ortho down the road it's just like a kid who has nearsightedness 
<Sync time="2538.750"/>
 are you gonna tell a parent a 3 year-old whose kid is nearsighted you know what they'd be a good candidate for glasses someday why don't we give them when they're like driving a car then you have to pay for them once that's how ridiculous medically indefensible it is to say that you should delay orthodontics because a kid only as baby teeth 
<Sync time="2556.345"/>
 if anybody has children or first order second order relatives grand kids kids you may be the first person to recognize
<Sync time="2565.21"/>
 ask the parent
<Sync time="2566.903"/>
 watch and see if the kid is (snoring) 
<Sync time="2569.005"/>
 and you might be the person to to really help that kid avoid the problem
<Sync time="2573.378"/>
 okay so I'm done I got more but got to end here so we can do some questions
<Sync time="2578.915"/>
 @applause
<Sync time="2582.088"/>
 @garbage-until-the-end
<Sync time="2582.802"/>
 about mismatch and male but 
<Sync time="2594.055"/>
 there are other reasons 
<Sync time="2598.135"/>
 for why evolution as powerful cannot sculpt perfect 
<Sync time="2604.630"/>
 arms race race with pathogens especially Scott presentation seemed affected for the mismatch effect of dense acellular carbohydrates is as tilted the playing field toward more virulent pathogenic bacterial species in 
<Sync time="2623.545"/>
 the mouth so how it mismatched intersects with another major category 
<Sync time="2632.935"/>
 was rushed for time before dimension other thing germs for gum disease have never changed always had we never had gum disease so 
<Sync time="2648.445"/>
 is it the germs or is the environment that 
<Sync time="2653.755"/>
 I 
<Sync time="2656.320"/>
 terms dense acellular carbohydrates just one there are lots of a 
<Sync time="2663.300"/>
 Ted Geisel we really 
<Sync time="2667.705"/>
 salivary is very important and not sleeping properly exhausted you're stressed so even if a nutrientdense diet you 
<Sync time="2684.055"/>
 so other words of the quality of your saliva 
<Sync time="2688.015"/>
 but it's not flowing you know you can heal demineralization also mouth breathing during poor sleep mouth breathing is dries the mouth 
<Sync time="2700.195"/>
 or intraarticular answers short so we can get more questions that that's a great question and it is a combination same thing with cavity 
<Sync time="2710.125"/>
 caries organisms they've been with us forever even use them to track migrations out of Africa strep mutants is the primary cariogenic bacteria 
<Sync time="2719.860"/>
 Paige Caulfield at Alabama actually bred Alabama 
<Sync time="2725.545"/>
 trap he uses that to track migrations because those bacteria have been with us they've just never been pathogenic mean lack these deficiency isn't pathogenic you drink milk so it's the environment that change 
<Sync time="2739.135"/>
 into 
<Sync time="2741.305"/>
 this 
<Sync time="2747.030"/>
 press 
<Sync time="2754.385"/>
 there some magic or some key nutrient 
<Sync time="2761.290"/>
 to 
<Sync time="2773.170"/>
 that one thing 
<Sync time="2784.615"/>
 Western price did Darwin and I would say 
<Sync time="2790.375"/>
 that were some parts 
<Sync time="2794.400"/>
 so dark Darwin got things wrong price Einstein 
<Sync time="2800.950"/>
 K thing far stretched the chewing 
<Sync time="2807.000"/>
 you passed 
<Sync time="2809.635"/>
 absolutely so not diminish 
<Sync time="2815.515"/>
 steps right direction 
<Sync time="2819.925"/>
 that can't build a perfect 
<Sync time="2823.030"/>
 the nutrients you deserve so yes the nutrients are we just put the spotlight some we try to connect the dots and we're pretty 
<Sync time="2838.240"/>
 with vitamin I 
<Sync time="2844.090"/>
 Western price 
<Sync time="2849.400"/>
 related constituents 
<Sync time="2856.165"/>
 data so with 
<Sync time="2864.640"/>
 groups one study was produced was 
<Sync time="2873.640"/>
 show you 
<Sync time="2877.105"/>
 make vitamin K deficient and they had stunted growth growth stunted maxilla 
<Sync time="2888.100"/>
 but it was stunted now 
<Sync time="2893.105"/>
 with confusing pathology with 
<Sync time="2899.080"/>
 vitamin deficiency is a pathological 
<Sync time="2904.660"/>
 I would say that the facial forms of everyone in the audience not grown correctly based on ancestral 
<Sync time="2916.945"/>
 so 
<Sync time="2919.510"/>
 you have 
<Sync time="2923.035"/>
 very rare significant 
<Sync time="2927.925"/>
 so yet really to find good evidence against to support 
<Sync time="2938.935"/>
 a question 
<Sync time="2945.130"/>
 other 
<Sync time="2948.325"/>
 avoid 
<Sync time="2955.420"/>
 oral rinses thanks 
<Sync time="2964.030"/>
 no nose breathing is key as young as early in life as pass that's my contribution like we have three dentists appear 
<Sync time="2974.260"/>
 thing I want to attack but that the only 
<Sync time="2979.045"/>
 you think Scott well it starts with maternal and paternal nutrition years 
<Sync time="2988.900"/>
 Scott start 
<Sync time="2991.675"/>
 once the child 
<Sync time="2994.705"/>
 you can see sometimes there 
<Sync time="2997.855"/>
 retro 
<Sync time="2999.880"/>
 jaws back so afterwards it's critical 
<Sync time="3005.130"/>
 what is going with facial for they have teeth 
<Sync time="3010.485"/>
 yes 
<Sync time="3012.690"/>
 paleo diet 
<Sync time="3015.450"/>
 not actually in the basis of recommending any specific but stay 
<Sync time="3023.550"/>
 our nutrients into your body you should be processed relating 
<Sync time="3034.630"/>
 probiotics 
<Sync time="3042.045"/>
 to me it's like if you're running 
<Sync time="3048.460"/>
 a nicer zoo tigers bears 
<Sync time="3053.925"/>
 but are rabbit pellets 
<Sync time="3058.080"/>
 bare feed 
<Sync time="3061.455"/>
 and if you have a zoo that's full of deer have so yes you can introduce bacteria probiotics that's all well but the environment that 
<Sync time="3074.355"/>
 is really what brings fish Finding dentist I have a fish tank office 
<Sync time="3081.480"/>
 algae or whatever in there but it got in there and it's growing because it's a good environment for the bottle get 
<Sync time="3091.905"/>
 so that is and don't smoke 
<Sync time="3099.435"/>
 tobacco or 
<Sync time="3106.500"/>
 oral microbiome excessive brush mentioned out and 
<Sync time="3116.385"/>
 carry 
<Sync time="3119.055"/>
 already disrupted or altered xylitol getting of attention and the pediatric dentistry and I never been Pro any one nutrient really down on sugar but there some impressive information 
<Sync time="3137.955"/>
 sila tall so stay tuned I agree 
<Sync time="3143.820"/>
 gum gum recession 
<Sync time="3148.725"/>
 gum recession like Mike's Mike's opinion because he's North Adonis and commonly that is a problem so well holding lots teeth out 
<Sync time="3161.005"/>
 with retainers now you might on the teeth 
<Sync time="3166.260"/>
 cheeks 
<Sync time="3168.420"/>
 side that 
<Sync time="3172.420"/>
 if you need wear retainer you're holding teeth out of 
<Sync time="3179.250"/>
 whole gum tissue 
<Sync time="3184.500"/>
 I won't mention it's probably word few of you have heard it's called an Abbe fraction so some of you may notice up 
<Sync time="3194.865"/>
 touch it's very sore notch there that's generally from the teeth colliding together if they're not aligned or grinder 
<Sync time="3205.425"/>
 real heavy gum chewer forces connection 
<Sync time="3211.005"/>
 by the gum line recession still yet another reason to get your children's jaws their tongue early in life 
<Sync time="3220.830"/>
 prevents adult problems start so don't if your instincts says my kid needs their jaw expanded the orthodontist as 
<Sync time="3232.335"/>
 well this or 
<Sync time="3235.740"/>
 gum disease orthodontics subsequent 
<Sync time="3241.740"/>
 so we have to current 
<Sync time="3247.335"/>
 fake
