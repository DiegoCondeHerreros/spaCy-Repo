my  O
next  O
patient  O
is  O
mai  B-MISC

   
and  O
she  O
is  O
a  O
female  O
about  O
14  O
years  O
old  O

   
and  O
she's  O
got  O
a  O
very  O
constricted  O
arch  O
and  O
a  O
tooth  O
size  O
discrepancy  O

   
we're  O
talking  O
at  O
this  O
time  O
in  O
this  O
session  O
about  O
the  O
bolton  B-MISC
analysis  O
i'm  B-MISC
gonna  O
cover  O
that  O
in  O
this  O
presentation  O

   
but  O
right  O
now  O
we're  O
gonna  O
talk  O
about  O
this  O
14  O
year-old  O
girl  O
now  O
remember  O
most  O
girls  O
will  O
grow  O
to  O
14  O
or  O
15  O

   
so  O
she  O
still  O
could  O
have  O
some  O
growth  O
potential  O
left  O

   
but  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
with  O
her  O
smile  O
is  O
very  O
narrow  O
here  O

   
got  O
a  O
very  O
narrow  O
constricted  O
arch  O
very  O
narrow  O
smile  O
and  O
we  O
wanna  O
fix  O
that  O

   
she's  O
also  O
got  O
two  O
lingually  O
displaced  O
lateral  O
incisors  O

   
and  O
she's  O
got  O
two  O
deciduous  O
lateral  O
incisors  O
in  O
position  O
but  O
the  O
permanent  O
lateral  O
incisors  O
are  O
lingually  O
displaced  O

   
and  O
we've  O
talked  O
about  O
this  O
many  O
times  O
but  O
the  O
reason  O
that  O
the  O
lateral  O
incisors  O
come  O
in  O
lingually  O
displaced  O
is  O
'cause  O
you've  O
got  O
a  O
narrow  O
constricted  O
upper  O
arch  O

   
so  O
that  O
all  O
could  O
have  O
been  O
avoided  O
if  O
she'd  O
had  O
a  O
an  O
an  O
expansion  O
appliance  O
when  O
she  O
was  O
6  O
7  O
8  O
9  O
10  O
11  O
whenever  O

   
or  O
she  O
wore  O
it  O
actually  O
earlier  O
before  O
the  O
laterals  O
erupted  O
so  O
so  O
the  O
earlier  O
the  O
better  O
probably  O
the  O
expansion  O
appliance  O
should  O
have  O
come  O
in  O
at  O
6  O
or  O
7  O

   
and  O
then  O
they  O
would  O
have  O
been  O
room  O
for  O
the  O
lateral  O
incisors  O
and  O
then  O
hopefully  O
they  O
wouldn't  O
have  O
erupted  O
in  O
the  O
lingual  O

   
so  O
again  O
that's  O
why  O
the  O
the  O
treatment  O
of  O
children  O
at  O
an  O
early  O
age  O
diagnosis  O
and  O
treatment  O
is  O
so  O
important  O

   
her  O
profile  O
looks  O
very  O
straight  O

   
in  O
fact  O
it  O
looks  O
almost  O
prognathic  O
it  O
looks  O
like  O
she  O
could  O
be  O
a  O
slight  O
class  O
3  O
she's  O
either  O
a  O
class  O
3  O
or  O
a  O
class  O
1  O
and  O
again  O
i  B-MISC
don't  O
have  O
the  O
ceph  O
in  O
the  O
presentation  O

   
but  O
i  B-MISC
have  O
the  O
ceph  O
and  O
all  O
the  O
records  O
for  O
all  O
the  O
cases  O
but  O
i  B-MISC
just  O
haven't  O
shown  O
you  O
all  O
the  O
cephs  O
and  O
all  O
the  O
records  O
for  O
all  O
the  O
cases  O
but  O
for  O
sure  O
she  O
looks  O
like  O
she  O
could  O
be  O
a  O
slight  O
class  O
3  O
or  O
or  O
a  O
class  O
1  O

   
let's  O
look  O
at  O
the  O
at  O
the  O
occlusion  O

   
well  O
if  O
you  O
look  O
carefully  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
she's  O
almost  O
end-to-end  O

   
and  O
over  O
in  O
this  O
photo  O
on  O
the  O
left  O
it  O
looks  O
like  O
the  O
lower  O
incisors  O
are  O
lingually  O
torqued  O

   
so  O
when  O
you  O
see  O
the  O
lower  O
incisor  O
lingually  O
torqued  O
you've  O
got  O
to  O
be  O
suspicious  O
of  O
a  O
class  O
3  O

   
plus  O
the  O
cuspid  O
is  O
slightly  O
class  O
3  O
plus  O
the  O
molar  O
is  O
definitely  O
class  O
3  O

   
so  O
you've  O
got  O
a  O
class  O
3  O
molar  O
class  O
3  O
cuspid  O
lower  O
incisors  O
lingually  O
inclined  O
that's  O
a  O
class  O
3  O

   
and  O
you  O
hope  O
now  O
that  O
she's  O
all  O
through  O
growing  O

   
but  O
remember  O
she's  O
14  O
she  O
could  O
grow  O
to  O
15  O
and  O
sometimes  O
class  O
3  O
s  O
even  O
grow  O
longer  O

   
so  O
we  O
have  O
to  O
be  O
aware  O
of  O
that  O
we  O
have  O
to  O
worry  O
that  O
that  O
the  O
mandible  O
might  O
come  O
forward  O
on  O
us  O
and  O
then  O
that's  O
definitely  O
a  O
concern  O

   
the  O
other  O
thing  O
that  O
we  O
look  O
at  O
is  O
we  O
can  O
see  O
remember  O
i  B-MISC
told  O
you  O
there's  O
the  O
lateral  O
incisor  O
that's  O
lingually  O
displaced  O
there's  O
th-  O
the  O
deciduous  O
lateral  O
there's  O
the  O
two  O
bicuspids  O
in  O
crossbite  O
and  O
if  O
you  O
look  O
here  O
at  O
the  O
frontal  O
photo  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
that  O
both  O
sides  O
look  O
like  O
they're  O
going  O
in  O

   
it  O
looks  O
like  O
a  O
very  O
constricted  O
upper  O
arch  O

   
we  O
like  O
to  O
see  O
a  O
nice  O
broad  O
arch  O
we  O
don't  O
like  O
to  O
see  O
a  O
constricted  O
arch  O
again  O
this  O
case  O
should  O
have  O
been  O
treated  O
earlier  O

   
so  O
we  O
look  O
at  O
we  O
look  O
at  O
that  O
situation  O
and  O
and  O
the  O
other  O
thing  O
you  O
have  O
to  O
remember  O
is  O
when  O
you  O
expand  O
an  O
arch  O
you  O
sometimes  O
open  O
the  O
bite  O

   
now  O
she's  O
end-to-end  O
here  O
she's  O
got  O
like  O
a  O
1  O
millimeter  O
overjet  O
and  O
1  O
millimeter  O
overbite  O

   
so  O
when  O
you  O
expand  O
an  O
arch  O
you  O
have  O
to  O
worry  O
about  O
the  O
bite  O
opening  O
in  O
the  O
front  O

   
when  O
you  O
expand  O
an  O
arch  O
on  O
a  O
class  O
3  O
and  O
you  O
free  O
up  O
the  O
mandible  O
and  O
the  O
patient  O
still  O
has  O
some  O
growth  O
potential  O
left  O
then  O
the  O
mandible  O
could  O
come  O
forward  O
so  O
she  O
could  O
come  O
forward  O
into  O
a  O
class  O
three  O
so  O
this  O
looks  O
like  O
a  O
relatively  O
easy  O
case  O
but  O
you  O
have  O
to  O
be  O
aware  O
that  O
this  O
could  O
this  O
could  O
be  O
a  O
more  O
difficult  O
case  O

   
if  O
the  O
bite  O
opens  O
and  O
if  O
if  O
the  O
mandible  O
comes  O
forward  O
then  O
it's  O
not  O
an  O
easy  O
case  O
so  O
so  O
class  O
3  O
potential  O
cases  O
are  O
not  O
easy  O
cases  O

   
and  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
she  O
has  O
some  O
other  O
interesting  O
things  O
happening  O
here  O

   
again  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
the  O
lateral  O
incisors  O
on  O
the  O
palate  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
the  O
deciduous  O
laterals  O
in  O
place  O
and  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
a  O
very  O
constricted  O
archs  O
particularly  O
area  O
of  O
the  O
bicuspids  O

   
and  O
you  O
can  O
also  O
see  O
that  O
that  O
the  O
l-  O
the  O
the  O
upper  O
first  O
bicuspids  O
are  O
much  O
larger  O
than  O
the  O
upper  O
second  O
bicuspids  O
there's  O
quite  O
a  O
tooth  O
size  O
discrepancy  O
here  O

   
so  O
look  O
at  O
the  O
size  O
of  O
the  O
upper  O
first  O
bicuspid  O
and  O
then  O
the  O
upper  O
second  O
bicuspid  O
and  O
look  O
at  O
the  O
lower  O
bicuspids  O
the  O
lower  O
bicuspids  O
both  O
look  O
normal  O
size  O

   
so  O
again  O
you'd  O
have  O
to  O
worry  O
that  O
if  O
you  O
had  O
a  O
tooth  O
size  O
discrepancy  O
are  O
you  O
going  O
to  O
get  O
a  O
proper  O
occlusion  O
at  O
the  O
end  O

   
are  O
the  O
are  O
the  O
occlusion  O
in  O
the  O
area  O
of  O
the  O
bicuspids  O
and  O
the  O
cuspids  O
gonna  O
be  O
normal  O
when  O
you've  O
got  O
such  O
a  O
large  O
upper  O
first  O
bicuspid  O
such  O
a  O
small  O
second  O
bicuspid  O
and  O
then  O
and  O
normal  O
size  O
lower  O
bicuspids  O

   
i  O
think  O
you  O
should  O
mention  O
that  O
to  O
the  O
patient  O
that  O
you  O
know  O
y-  O
you  O
have  O
some  O
different  O
shaped  O
teeth  O
that  O
might  O
make  O
it  O
difficult  O
to  O
get  O
a  O
final  O
perfect  O
finish  O

   
we're  O
still  O
gonna  O
have  O
your  O
teeth  O
straight  O
you  O
still  O
gonna  O
have  O
a  O
nice  O
smile  O

   
but  O
maybe  O
that  O
the  O
the  O
bite  O
won't  O
be  O
absolutely  O
perfect  O
but  O
it'll  O
still  O
it'll  O
still  O
be  O
able  O
to  O
chew  O
to  O
your  O
food  O
you'll  O
still  O
be  O
fine  O
but  O
we  O
may  O
not  O
be  O
able  O
to  O
get  O
a  O
textbook  O
finish  O
because  O
we  O
don't  O
have  O
a  O
proper  O
sized  O
teeth  O
to  O
start  O
with  O

   
but  O
don't  O
worry  O
we'll  O
do  O
the  O
best  O
we  O
can  O

   
so  O
with  O
that  O
now  O
the  O
lower  O
arch  O
always  O
in  O
class  O
3  O
you've  O
got  O
a  O
broad  O
arch  O
and  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
that's  O
a  O
nice  O
broad  O
arch  O
the  O
other  O
interesting  O
thing  O
is  O
look  O
at  O
how  O
these  O
teeth  O
are  O
rolled  O
lingually  O

   
look  O
at  O
how  O
the  O
second  O
bicuspid  O
and  O
the  O
molars  O
are  O
torqued  O
lingually  O
like  O
this  O

   
so  O
you  O
know  O
that  O
when  O
we  O
put  O
our  O
straight  O
wire  O
brackets  O
on  O

   
remember  O
the  O
torque  O
on  O
our  O
on  O
our  O
bic-  O
bicuspids  O
and  O
molars  O
are  O
minus  O
12  O

   
so  O
the  O
torque  O
on  O
our  O
molars  O
minus  O
12  O
so  O
we  O
put  O
we  O
put  O
our  O
arch  O
wire  O
into  O
the  O
slot  O
the  O
tooth  O
is  O
gonna  O
go  O
to  O
minus  O
12  O

   
well  O
if  O
the  O
tooth  O
starts  O
out  O
in  O
minus  O
35  O
like  O
this  O

   
tooth  O
starts  O
out  O
at  O
minus  O
35  O
and  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
those  O
teeth  O
are  O
really  O
lingually  O
inclined  O
and  O
then  O
you  O
put  O
an  O
arch  O
wire  O
in  O
there  O
you're  O
gonna  O
upright  O
that  O
tooth  O
to  O
minus  O
12  O

   
so  O
we're  O
gonna  O
get  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
uprighting  O
on  O
the  O
lower  O
arch  O
with  O
our  O
brackets  O

   
pre-program  O
brackets  O
to  O
upright  O
to  O
minus  O
12  O

   
so  O
we're  O
definitely  O
gonna  O
have  O
to  O
expand  O
and  O
upright  O
those  O
already  O
in  O
crossbite  O
but  O
when  O
the  O
lowers  O
upright  O
we're  O
gonna  O
have  O
to  O
expand  O
the  O
upper  O
or  O
they'll  O
all  O
gonna  O
be  O
in  O
buccal  O
crossbite  O

   
so  O
you  O
have  O
to  O
consider  O
that  O
and  O
look  O
carefully  O
to  O
arches  O

   
and  O
both  O
sides  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
the  O
molars  O
and  O
the  O
bicuspids  O
are  O
definitely  O
lingually  O
inclined  O
and  O
the  O
incisor  O
look  O
very  O
upright  O

   
or  O
maybe  O
slightly  O
lingually  O
inclined  O

   
so  O
that's  O
very  O
common  O
in  O
class  O
3  O
s  O

   
so  O
that's  O
the  O
case  O

   
again  O
very  O
large  O
upper  O
first  O
bicuspid  O
is  O
very  O
small  O
second  O
bicuspid  O
tooth  O
size  O
discrepancy  O

   
you  O
need  O
to  O
do  O
the  O
bolton  B-MISC
analysis  O
on  O
your  O
cases  O
prior  O
to  O
treatment  O
to  O
say  O
if  O
you  O
do  O
have  O
a  O
tooth  O
size  O
discrepancy  O

   
if  O
you  O
do  O
you  O
need  O
to  O
mention  O
that  O
to  O
the  O
patients  O
ahead  O
of  O
time  O
so  O
their  O
expectations  O
for  O
a  O
sore  O
so-called  O
perfect  O
finish  O
are  O
not  O
there  O

   
so  O
my  O
treatment  O
plan  O
was  O
to  O
use  O
a  O
banded  O
hyrax  O
on  O
the  O
upper  O
i  B-MISC
i  I-MISC
like  O
the  O
banded  O
hyrax  O
it's  O
one  O
of  O
my  O
favorite  O
appliances  O

   
you  O
can  O
make  O
it  O
with  O
a  O
memory  O
screw  O
where  O
you  O
turn  O
the  O
screw  O
or  O
you  O
can  O
make  O
with  O
a  O
regular  O
her  O
where  O
the  O
patient  O
turns  O
the  O
screw  O
twice  O
a  O
week  O

   
and  O
it  O
consists  O
of  O
a  O
band  O
on  O
the  O
first  O
molars  O
and  O
mesial  O
rests  O
on  O
the  O
first  O
bicuspids  O
and  O
and  O
a  O
hyrax  O
screw  O
it's  O
a  O
very  O
simple  O
appliance  O
and  O
it's  O
a  O
very  O
effective  O
appliance  O

   
so  O
there  O
we  O
have  O
it  O
we  O
have  O
the  O
the  O
midline  O
screw  O

   
and  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
the  O
arrows  O

   
and  O
we  O
have  O
keys  O
now  O
that  O
have  O
a  O
light  O

   
and  O
those  O
keys  O
with  O
a  O
light  O
on  O
in  O
are  O
excellent  O

   
and  O
you  O
need  O
to  O
talk  O
to  O
the  O
labs  O
and  O
because  O
the  O
parents  O
when  O
they're  O
trying  O
to  O
adjust  O
that  O
or  O
or  O
she's  O
trying  O
to  O
adjust  O
it  O
she  O
can't  O
see  O
back  O
there  O

   
so  O
we  O
have  O
a  O
light  O

   
you  O
can  O
even  O
shine  O
the  O
light  O
on  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
with  O
that  O

   
i  O
i'm  I-MISC
pointing  O
right  O
now  O
to  O
the  O
to  O
the  O
opening  O
and  O
the  O
screw  O
and  O
you  O
put  O
your  O
key  O
in  O
that  O

   
and  O
and  O
the  O
arrows  O
are  O
going  O
back  O
and  O
they'll  O
turn  O
it  O
back  O
all  O
the  O
way  O

   
you  O
see  O
put  O
the  O
key  O
in  O
the  O
anterior  O
part  O
and  O
turn  O
it  O
back  O
and  O
then  O
take  O
it  O
out  O

   
and  O
the  O
key  O
is  O
on  O
a  O
swivel  O

   
so  O
get  O
the  O
key  O
with  O
a  O
with  O
a  O
light  O

   
they're  O
not  O
that  O
expensive  O
and  O
the  O
lab  O
will  O
include  O
that  O
with  O
a  O
appliance  O

   
and  O
that'll  O
make  O
it  O
easier  O
for  O
the  O
patient  O
to  O
adjust  O
that  O
appliance  O
and  O
they'll  O
need  O
to  O
adjust  O
it  O
twice  O
a  O
week  O

   
i  O
tell  O
them  O
every  O
wednesday  B-MISC
every  O
saturday  B-MISC
every  O
wednesday  B-MISC
every  O
saturday  B-MISC
then  O
they'll  O
remember  O

   
so  O
with  O
the  O
cemented  O
bands  O
i  B-MISC
never  O
gonna  O
put  O
flowable  O
composite  O
on  O
the  O
mesial  O
rests  O

   
and  O
remember  O
i've  B-MISC
told  O
this  O
before  O
i  B-MISC
like  O
to  O
fit  O
my  O
own  O
bands  O

   
so  O
bring  O
the  O
patient  O
in  O
one  O
week  O
before  O

   
i  O
put  O
the  O
separators  O
mesial  O
and  O
distal  O
to  O
the  O
first  O
molars  O
on  O
both  O
sides  O

   
bring  O
the  O
patient  O
back  O
in  O
a  O
week  O
take  O
the  O
separators  O
out  O
fit  O
the  O
2  O
bands  O

   
take  O
the  O
band's  O
off  O
the  O
teeth  O
put  O
them  O
on  O
a  O
cotton  O
roll  O
slide  O
the  O
bands  O
on  O
a  O
cotton  O
roll  O
wrap  O
them  O
up  O
carefully  O
so  O
they  O
won't  O
get  O
distorted  O

   
take  O
an  O
upper  O
impression  O
of  O
the  O
of  O
the  O
molars  O
separated  O

   
poured  O
in  O
yellow  O
stone  O
and  O
send  O
the  O
upper  O
model  O
and  O
the  O
two  O
bands  O
to  O
the  O
lab  O
and  O
they'll  O
send  O
you  O
back  O
the  O
hyrax  O
and  O
you  O
know  O
it's  O
gonna  O
fit  O

   
because  O
you  O
fit  O
the  O
bands  O

   
if  O
you  O
ask  O
the  O
lab  O
to  O
fit  O
the  O
bands  O
and  O
they  O
scrape  O
the  O
model  O
sometimes  O
the  O
hyrax  O
won't  O
fit  O
the  O
bands  O
won't  O
fit  O
th-  O
with  O
the  O
patient  O
and  O
that's  O
not  O
good  O

   
so  O
we  O
recommend  O
that's  O
you  O
fit  O
the  O
bands  O
plus  O
you're  O
gonna  O
have  O
your  O
tubes  O
on  O
the  O
buccal  O

   
so  O
as  O
soon  O
as  O
we  O
expand  O
we  O
get  O
to  O
#*  O
into  O
straight  O
wire  O
and  O
we've  O
got  O
our  O
brackets  O
on  O
the  O
on  O
the  O
teeth  O

   
we  O
want  O
our  O
brackets  O
on  O
the  O
on  O
the  O
teeth  O
with  O
the  O
with  O
the  O
proper  O
tip  O
and  O
torque  O

   
so  O
there  O
it  O
is  O
but  O
don't  O
forget  O
to  O
some  O
to  O
to  O
bond  O
with  O
flowable  O
composite  O
the  O
mesial  O
rests  O

   
otherwise  O
you've  O
just  O
got  O
2  O
teeth  O
holding  O
while  O
you  O
want  O
retention  O
of  O
4  O
teeth  O

   
the  O
reason  O
you  O
have  O
the  O
rest  O
is  O
because  O
this  O
bar  O
right  O
here  O
if  O
you  O
don't  O
put  O
the  O
rest  O
on  O
the  O
mesial  O
besides  O
giving  O
it  O
better  O
retention  O
that  O
bar  O
could  O
dig  O
in  O
right  O
here  O
on  O
the  O
palate  O
and  O
cause  O
discomfort  O
for  O
the  O
patient  O

   
so  O
always  O
use  O
mesial  O
rests  O

   
so  O
here's  O
the  O
base  O
and  O
now  O
we've  O
expanded  O
the  O
hyrax  O
4  O
millimeters  O

   
we  O
i  B-MISC
usually  O
like  O
to  O
do  O
the  O
expansion  O
first  O
before  O
i  B-MISC
put  O
the  O
straight  O
wire  O
on  O
it  O

   
'cause  O
i  O
find  O
when  O
there  O
is  O
more  O
room  O
in  O
the  O
arch  O
then  O
they  O
the  O
brackets  O
come  O
on  O
better  O
and  O
the  O
teeth  O
aren't  O
so  O
sore  O
when  O
room  O
for  O
the  O
teeth  O
they  O
don't  O
hurt  O
nearly  O
as  O
much  O
when  O
you  O
straight  O
them  O

   
so  O
we've  O
expanded  O
4  O
millimeters  O
but  O
i  B-MISC
wanted  O
to  O
see  O
what's  O
happening  O
with  O
our  O
expansion  O
remember  O
i  B-MISC
told  O
you  O
when  O
you  O
expand  O
a  O
case  O
you  O
have  O
to  O
think  O
sometimes  O
the  O
bite  O
will  O
open  O

   
well  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
our  O
our  O
patient  O
now  O
has  O
got  O
a  O
but  O
a  O
[half  O
a  O
millimeter]  O
open  O
bite  O
here  O
on  O
the  O
right  O
side  O

   
and  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
that  O
the  O
cuspid  O
now  O
has  O
gone  O
into  O
class  O
3  O
and  O
the  O
molar  O
is  O
class  O
3  O

   
so  O
what's  O
happening  O
is  O
the  O
bite  O
is  O
opening  O
and  O
the  O
mandible  O
is  O
slowly  O
coming  O
forward  O
a  O
little  O
more  O
class  O
3  O
so  O
that  O
makes  O
the  O
case  O
a  O
lot  O
more  O
difficult  O

   
so  O
we're  O
losing  O
our  O
class  O
1  O
cuspid  O
we're  O
losing  O
our  O
class  O
1  O
molar  O
relationship  O
on  O
this  O
side  O
and  O
we're  O
opening  O
the  O
bite  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O
on  O
the  O
front  O
and  O
we're  O
just  O
getting  O
started  O

   
we've  O
only  O
opened  O
the  O
hyrax  O
screw  O
4  O
millimeters  O
and  O
we  O
need  O
more  O
expansion  O

   
now  O
we've  O
opened  O
6  O
millimeters  O

   
but  O
look  O
what's  O
happening  O
on  O
the  O
on  O
the  O
left  O
side  O

   
we  O
started  O
out  O
with  O
a  O
slight  O
class  O
3  O
cuspid  O
relationship  O
and  O
now  O
it's  O
about  O
2  O
or  O
3  O
millimeters  O
class  O
3  O

   
and  O
the  O
molar  O
is  O
worse  O
now  O
is  O
much  O
more  O
class  O
3  O
than  O
when  O
we  O
started  O

   
so  O
for  O
sure  O
the  O
mandible  O
because  O
you  O
expand  O
the  O
maxilla  O
the  O
mandible  O
is  O
coming  O
forward  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O

   
possibly  O
the  O
mandible  O
is  O
trapped  O
and  O
the  O
condyle  O
wants  O
to  O
move  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O
down  O
and  O
forward  O
to  O
a  O
more  O
comfortable  O
position  O

   
and  O
one  O
key  O
would  O
be  O
if  O
you  O
did  O
a  O
tmj  B-MISC
evaluation  O
of  O
the  O
patient  O
and  O
found  O
some  O
signs  O
and  O
symptoms  O
of  O
tmj  B-MISC
you  O
would  O
you  O
need  O
to  O
expect  O
it  O
to  O
happen  O

   
so  O
patients  O
with  O
temporomandibular  O
joint  O
dysfunction  O
and  O
you  O
expand  O
the  O
upper  O
arch  O
the  O
mandible  O
will  O
definitely  O
come  O
down  O
and  O
forward  O
trying  O
to  O
get  O
the  O
condyle  O
a  O
more  O
comfortable  O
position  O
in  O
the  O
glenoid  O
fossa  O
away  O
from  O
the  O
nerves  O
and  O
blood  O
vessels  O

   
the  O
patient  O
almost  O
decompresses  O
their  O
own  O
joint  O
if  O
you  O
allow  O
the  O
mandible  O
to  O
have  O
room  O
to  O
move  O
to  O
a  O
different  O
position  O

   
so  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
this  O
case  O
now  O
is  O
is  O
is  O
shaping  O
up  O
to  O
be  O
a  O
much  O
more  O
difficult  O
case  O
than  O
we  O
started  O
to  O
thought  O
in  O
the  O
beginning  O

   
because  O
we've  O
got  O
a  O
class  O
3  O
cuspid  O
class  O
3  O
molar  O

   
now  O
we're  O
almost  O
end-to-end  O
in  O
fact  O
almost  O
into  O
an  O
anterior  O
crossbite  O
here  O
we're  O
in  O
there  O
so  O
any  O
more  O
movement  O
we  O
could  O
go  O
into  O
crossbite  O

   
the  O
we  O
extracted  O
1  O
the  O
primary  O
lateral  O
on  O
the  O
on  O
the  O
on  O
the  O
left  O
side  O

   
and  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
the  O
permanent  O
laterals  O
there  O

   
and  O
we've  O
expanded  O
about  O
6  O
millimeters  O
now  O
so  O
maybe  O
we're  O
almost  O
into  O
position  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
here  O
on  O
the  O
on  O
the  O
on  O
the  O
right  O
side  O
sorry  O
on  O
the  O
left  O
side  O
we've  O
extracted  O
that  O
primary  O
lateral  O
now  O
we're  O
gonna  O
straight-  O
straighten  O
that  O
one  O
lateral  O
incisor  O

   
a  O
lot  O
my  O
patients  O
like  O
the  O
clear  O
brackets  O

   
well  O
i  B-MISC
have  O
2  O
typodonts  O
actually  O
i've  B-MISC
3  O
typodonts  O
i've  B-MISC
got  O
one  O
typodont  O
with  O
the  O
diamond  B-MISC
brackets  O
and  O
the  O
colored  O
ligature  O
ties  O
which  O
i  B-MISC
show  O
the  O
children  O

   
i've  O
got  O
another  O
typodont  O
with  O
the  O
clear  O
brackets  O

   
and  O
the  O
clear  O
brackets  O
that  O
i  B-MISC
have  O
now  O
are  O
called  O
the  O
neolucent  B-MISC
clear  O
brackets  O

   
i  O
get  O
those  O
from  O
ortho  B-MISC
organizers  I-MISC
in  O
the  O
united  B-MISC
states  I-MISC
and  O
i  B-MISC
get  O
them  O
from  O
cerum  B-MISC
ortho  I-MISC
in  O
canada  B-MISC
and  O
they're  O
excellent  O
they're  O
translucent  O
brackets  O
and  O
they  O
are  O
really  O
nice  O
because  O
you  O
the  O
the  O
the  O
true  O
color  O
of  O
the  O
tooth  O
comes  O
right  O
to  O
#*  O
and  O
you  O
can  O
hardly  O
see  O
the  O
brackets  O

   
this  O
was  O
a  O
technique  O
that  O
we  O
tried  O
for  O
a  O
while  O
when  O
we  O
put  O
these  O
crosses  O
on  O
here  O

   
but  O
the  O
trouble  O
with  O
those  O
crosses  O
was  O
they  O
only  O
came  O
in  O
one  O
color  O
and  O
and  O
if  O
you  O
have  O
different  O
color  O
teeth  O
sometimes  O
they  O
look  O
good  O
sometimes  O
they  O
didn't  O

   
what  O
we're  O
trying  O
to  O
do  O
is  O
get  O
away  O
from  O
the  O
ligature  O
ties  O
that  O
stain  O
that's  O
the  O
big  O
disadvantage  O
of  O
the  O
clear  O
brackets  O
is  O
the  O
ligature  O
tie  O
stain  O

   
we've  O
got  O
smoky  O
and  O
pearl  O

   
two  O
ligature  O
ties  O
by  O
ortho  B-MISC
organizers  I-MISC
that  O
don't  O
stain  O
as  O
much  O
okay  O
so  O
it's  O
called  O
pearl  O
and  O
smokey  O
so  O
those  O
the  O
ones  O
we  O
use  O
now  O

   
we've  O
used  O
these  O
crosses  O
for  O
a  O
while  O
but  O
we  O
don't  O
use  O
those  O
anymore  O
we've  O
found  O
that  O
they  O
weren't  O
they  O
weren't  O
very  O
effective  O

   
so  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
but  O
this  O
case  O
had  O
the  O
crosses  O
and  O
we  O
just  O
put  O
we  O
put  O
the  O
brackets  O
on  O
cuspid  O
to  O
cuspid  O

   
the  O
the  O
clear  O
brackets  O
are  O
more  O
bulky  O
than  O
the  O
metal  O
brackets  O
but  O
they  O
look  O
a  O
lot  O
better  O
and  O
lot  O
of  O
patients  O
want  O
them  O

   
but  O
if  O
you  O
can  O
get  O
away  O
with  O
just  O
going  O
from  O
cuspid  O
to  O
cuspid  O
with  O
the  O
clear  O
brackets  O
try  O
that  O
because  O
then  O
the  O
metal  O
brackets  O
are  O
are  O
less  O
bulky  O
on  O
the  O
bicuspids  O
and  O
and  O
a  O
little  O
easier  O
on  O
the  O
patient's  O
cheek  O

   
they  O
don't  O
they  O
don't  O
protrude  O
as  O
much  O

   
so  O
we've  O
just  O
tied  O
that  O
in  O
now  O
with  O
an  O
o  O
1  O
4  O
[.014]  O
ni  O
ti  I-MISC
wire  O
that's  O
our  O
number  O
1  O
leveling  O
wire  O
we  O
start  O
most  O
of  O
our  O
cases  O
with  O
that  O

   
so  O
with  O
60  O
grams  O
of  O
force  O
we  O
can  O
bend  O
it  O
87  O
degrees  O
you  O
won't  O
distort  O
it  O
it's  O
an  O
excellent  O
wire  O
very  O
light  O
gentle  O
continuous  O
forces  O

   
its  O
nickel  O
titanium  O

   
we  O
call  O
it  O
ni  B-MISC
ti  I-MISC

   
and  O
and  O
now  O
we've  O
tied  O
everything  O
in  O
so  O
it  O
goes  O
right  O
back  O
to  O
the  O
molar  O
remember  O
the  O
molars  O
got  O
a  O
hyrax  O

   
now  O
it  O
looks  O
like  O
we've  O
overexpanded  O
the  O
upper  O

   
but  O
remember  O
the  O
lower  O
teeth  O
haven't  O
haven't  O
been  O
bracketed  O
yet  O
and  O
they're  O
gonna  O
upright  O
with  O
the  O
torque  O
that's  O
built  O
into  O
my  O
brackets  O
the  O
minus  O
12  O
torque  O

   
it's  O
built  O
in  O
the  O
cuspids  O
sorry  O
the  O
bicuspid  O
the  O
molars  O
so  O
those  O
teeth  O
and  O
upright  O
on  O
their  O
own  O
with  O
just  O
the  O
wires  O

   
so  O
we  O
have  O
to  O
overexpand  O
anticipating  O
that  O

   
so  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
we've  O
tied  O
everything  O
in  O

   
here  O
it  O
is  O
now  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
occlusal  O
view  O
you've  O
open  O
6  O
millimeters  O
the  O
hyrax  O
has  O
opened  O
6  O
millimeters  O

   
and  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
that  O
the  O
o  O
1  O
4  O
[.014]  O
nickel  O
titanium  O
#*  O
is  O
tied  O
in  O

   
and  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
that  O
for  O
sure  O
the  O
the  O
clear  O
brackets  O
are  O
definitely  O
bulkier  O
than  O
the  O
metal  O
brackets  O

   
there  O
is  O
the  O
metal  O
bracket  O
in  O
the  O
bicuspid  O
there's  O
the  O
clear  O
bracket  O
on  O
the  O
on  O
the  O
lateral  O
but  O
patients  O
don't  O
care  O
usually  O
they  O
they  O
don't  O
care  O
they  O
want  O
the  O
appearance  O

   
they  O
don't  O
want  O
the  O
brackets  O
that  O
show  O

   
and  O
and  O
and  O
i  B-MISC
think  O
clear  O
brackets  O
are  O
vastly  O
underrated  O

   
i  O
mean  O
most  O
patients  O
don't  O
even  O
know  O
about  O
clear  O
brackets  O

   
so  O
you  O
really  O
should  O
have  O
some  O
brochures  O
in  O
your  O
office  O
in  O
your  O
waiting  O
room  O
showing  O
pages  O
about  O
clear  O
brackets  O
so  O
they  O
know  O
by  O
the  O
clear  O
brackets  O

   
everybody  O
knows  O
about  O
invisalign  B-MISC

   
everybody  O
knows  O
about  O
metal  O
brackets  O

   
they  O
don't  O
know  O
about  O
clear  O
brackets  O

   
and  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
patients  O
in  O
my  O
practice  O
that  O
wouldn't  O
have  O
braces  O
unless  O
i  B-MISC
offer  O
them  O
the  O
clear  O

   
so  O
i  B-MISC
always  O
show  O
them  O
the  O
clear  O
brackets  O
and  O
and  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
them  O
want  O
that  O

   
if  O
they  O
want  O
faster  O
treatment  O
of  O
course  O
we  O
go  O
to  O
self-ligating  O
brackets  O

   
if  O
they  O
want  O
they  O
want  O
the  O
fastest  O
treatment  O
they  O
go  O
self-ligating  O
with  O
no  O
colored  O
ligature  O
ties  O
if  O
they  O
want  O
a  O
little  O
slower  O
treatment  O
but  O
they  O
want  O
nice  O
aesthetic  O
result  O
then  O
they  O
go  O
with  O
the  O
clear  O

   
so  O
again  O
we  O
haven't  O
ti-  O
we  O
haven't  O
activated  O
the  O
there's  O
no  O
room  O
for  O
this  O
lateral  O
on  O
the  O
lingual  O
on  O
the  O
on  O
the  O
right  O

   
but  O
over  O
here  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
there  O
is  O
room  O
for  O
the  O
for  O
the  O
lateral  O
on  O
the  O
left  O

   
so  O
if  O
there's  O
the  O
room  O
for  O
the  O
lateral  O
on  O
the  O
left  O
we  O
tie  O
in  O
the  O
left  O
lateral  O
but  O
the  O
right  O
lateral  O
we're  O
gonna  O
leave  O
for  O
a  O
while  O
and  O
then  O
we  O
have  O
to  O
put  O
an  O
open  O
coil  O
in  O
there  O
to  O
make  O
space  O
for  O
that  O
too  O

   
@void  O

   
so  O
again  O
this  O
tooth  O
is  O
lingually  O
displaced  O
here  O

   
and  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
now  O
it's  O
tied  O
in  O
and  O
it's  O
it's  O
it's  O
looking  O
good  O

   
okay  O
so  O
it  O
probably  O
took  O
about  O
2  O
months  O
we  O
have  O
to  O
tie  O
in  O
that  O
tooth  O
3  O
at  O
the  O
most  O
to  O
get  O
that  O
tooth  O
into  O
position  O

   
now  O
the  O
hyrax  O
is  O
open  O
10  O
millimeters  O

   
lots  O
of  O
expansion  O
'cause  O
remember  O
those  O
lowers  O
we  O
wanna  O
upright  O
we  O
want  O
a  O
nice  O
broad  O
smile  O

   
and  O
now  O
we've  O
got  O
an  O
open  O
coil  O
over  O
here  O
to  O
make  O
room  O
for  O
the  O
right  O
lateral  O
incisor  O
so  O
left  O
lateral  O
incisor  O
is  O
in  O
line  O
now  O
we're  O
gonna  O
put  O
an  O
open  O
coil  O
in  O
here  O
to  O
try  O
to  O
make  O
room  O
for  O
the  O
right  O
lateral  O
incisor  O
we  O
don't  O
wanna  O
tied  O
it  O
in  O
until  O
there's  O
room  O

   
so  O
there  O
we  O
have  O
it  O

   
the  O
patient  O
now  O
has  O
to  O
be  O
in  O
a  O
working  O
wire  O
remember  O
we  O
lined  O
up  O
the  O
left  O
lateral  O
with  O
a  O
with  O
a  O
leveling  O
wire  O
the  O
o  O
1  O
4  O
ni  O
ti  I-MISC

   
now  O
that  O
the  O
tooth  O
is  O
lined  O
up  O
and  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
it  O
there's  O
the  O
tooth  O
nicely  O
lined  O
up  O
the  O
left  O
lateral  O
is  O
in  O
position  O

   
now  O
what  O
we  O
wanna  O
do  O
we  O
want  O
to  O
make  O
room  O
for  O
the  O
right  O
lateral  O

   
so  O
i  B-MISC
put  O
a  O
piece  O
of  O
open  O
coil  O
on  O

   
remember  O
we  O
measure  O
from  O
the  O
mesial  O
of  O
the  O
cuspid  O
the  O
bracket  O
on  O
the  O
cuspid  O
to  O
the  O
distal  O
of  O
the  O
bracket  O
on  O
the  O
on  O
the  O
central  O
and  O
say  O
that's  O
say  O
that's  O
10  O
millimeters  O

   
so  O
you  O
got  O
10  O
plus  O
4  O
it's  O
14  O
millimeters  O

   
you  O
cut  O
a  O
piece  O
of  O
open  O
coil  O
of  O
14  O
millimeter  O
slide  O
it  O
on  O
the  O
arch  O
wire  O
and  O
then  O
compress  O
it  O

   
tie  O
it  O
in  O
and  O
then  O
it  O
tries  O
to  O
do  O
that  O
with  O
a  O
compressed  O
coil  O
of  O
14  O
the  O
space  O
is  O
only  O
10  O
as  O
soon  O
as  O
you  O
take  O
off  O
the  O
as  O
soon  O
as  O
you  O
tie  O
in  O
the  O
brackets  O
it  O
wants  O
to  O
do  O
this  O
and  O
so  O
that  O
will  O
slowly  O
make  O
space  O

   
don't  O
use  O
more  O
than  O
4  O
or  O
you  O
might  O
cause  O
rotation  O
of  O
the  O
teeth  O
in  O
the  O
end  O

   
and  O
you're  O
trying  O
to  O
prevent  O
rotation  O
not  O
cause  O
rotations  O

   
so  O
we're  O
just  O
gonna  O
change  O
that  O
every  O
month  O
the  O
patient  O
comes  O
in  O
you  O
measure  O
the  O
space  O
at  O
4  O
millimeters  O
cut  O
new  O
piece  O
of  O
open  O
coil  O
and  O
put  O
in  O
there  O
it  O
might  O
take  O
3  O
months  O
to  O
make  O
the  O
space  O

   
and  O
we  O
must  O
be  O
in  O
a  O
working  O
wire  O

   
it's  O
got  O
2  O
working  O
wires  O

   
you've  O
got  O
the  O
o  O
1  O
8  O
[.018]  O

which  O
is  O
280  O

or  O
you've  O

the  O

but  O
now  O
we've  O
got  O
the  O
o  O
1  O

t-  I-MISC
o  O
1  O
8  O
cna  O
in  O
the  O
upper  O
and  O
in  O
the  O
bottom  O
we're  O
just  O
starting  O
to  O
line  O
the  O
teeth  O
up  O
so  O
we've  O
got  O
the  O
o  O
1  O

ni  O

at  O
the  O
bottom  O

   
now  O
if  O
the  O
if  O
the  O
teeth  O
are  O
pretty  O
straight  O
which  O
the  O
lower  O
ones  O
were  O
we  O
can  O
start  O
with  O
an  O

if  O
the  O
teeth  O
were  O
crooked  O
or  O
if  O
the  O

was  O
really  O
very  O

i  B-MISC
would  O
start  O
with  O
an  O

but  O
when  O
the  O

are  O

we  O
start  O
with  O
an  O

the  O
other  O
thing  O
you  O
have  O
to  O
worry  O
about  O
is  O
when  O
you  O
put  O
the  O
brackets  O
on  O
a  O
class  O
3  O
case  O
and  O
there's  O
and  O
there's  O
any  O
crowding  O
in  O
the  O
lower  O
the  O
lower  O
incisors  O
will  O
flare  O

   
and  O
you'll  O
cause  O
more  O
of  O
an  O
anterior  O
crossbite  O
which  O
you  O
don't  O
want  O

   
so  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
my  O
bite  O
is  O
opening  O
my  O
bite  O
is  O
opening  O
more  O

   
i've  O
got  O
a  O
1  O

anterior  O
open  O
bite  O
over  O
here  O

   
i've  O
got  O
my  O
cuspid  O
still  O

i've  O
got  O
my  O
molar  O
class  O

i've  O
got  O
my  O

in  O
down  O
here  O
to  O
put  O
a  O
molar  O
band  O
on  O
that  O
lower  O
molar  O

   
but  O
my  O
case  O
is  O
getting  O
more  O
difficult  O
isn't  O
it  O

   
i  O
mean  O
we're  O
we  O
are  O
developing  O
an  O
anterior  O
open  O
bite  O

   
where  O
where  O
where  O
the  O
mandible  O
is  O
coming  O
forward  O
i've  B-MISC
got  O
a  O

this  O
is  O
a  O
more  O
difficult  O
case  O
to  O
treat  O
