 @void 
 okay so thank you dean polverini and i'd also like to thank laurie mccauley for the organisation of this session today 
 i'm going looking forward to our our discussions that we're going to have later and i've very much appreciated doctor hassel's presentation giving a big picture to you on the world of personalised medicine as it may affect all areas of healthcare 
 and so my challenge this afternoon is to now put into perspective some of the opportunities that we have in dentistry notably in the areas of dental caries periodontal diseases and oral cancer as examples where we may be able to now start using personalized oral healthcare or personalized dentistry for the better healthcare delivery for our patients 
 genetics what can that mean the ability to perfect the physical and mental characteristics of every unborn child 
 #* 
 in a not too distant future 
 our dna will determine everything about us 
 a minute drop of blood 
 saliva or single hair 
 determines where you can work 
 who you should marry 
 what you're capable of achieving 
 @music 
 okay so this is a movie clip from gattaca and many of us might think that this is actually pretty far-fetched 
 but actually much of the technology that was utilized in the premise of this movie is actually available today 
 and it's really a matter of how we're going to use this genetic information for genetics and genomics research and the application of really using it in a in a proper manner and so 
 as a part of the presentation today later on doctor roberts is really gonna put much of this into the the clinical context 
 but as we start to now begin to consider many of the opportunities within personalized dentistry and personalized healthcare 
 i think i can relate to many areas that we have currently ongoing in dentistry and in oral health research 
 this isn't even just at the patient level but can also relate to the the response to microbial infection 
 if we take for example in periodontal diseases and dental caries 
 using molecular diagnostic approaches in identifying different types of pathogens that are afflicting our patients and seeing how that host parasite interaction actually occurs 
 also in the development of rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests we are going to have many opportunities not only working with centralized laboratories like what doctor hassel just recently presented 
 but in the future we are now beginning to have rapid point-of-care diagnosticswhere we might even have devices the size of this pointer here we're going to be able to deliver some sort of biological specimen and then have an analysis of our genomes 
 so you know how can we actually start using these approaches because in dentistry you know we've been using a form of personalized medicine for many years right 
 we treat each patient differently it's not necessarily one-size-fits-all 
 however when it comes to many of the different tools that we have in our armamentarium restorative biomaterials antibiotics pain medications often times we do use them in a very standardized manner 
 and so if we take one example such as in a case of 
 this was actually the development of a of a new tissue engineering construct part of a randomized control trial done here at the university of michigan 
 this is an example of a patient who had a very severe osseous defect around a single tooth 
 and this patient received a treatment that was highly successful 
 and this is a 10 year post-operative image following this treatment 
 but this another patient in the same clinical trial received the same tissue engineering construct and you can see at baseline and then you can see at the 6 month post-operative view that this patient went the opposite direction 
 and so how do we actually identify these patients who are going to respond well and those who may not respond quite so well 
 so this is actually some other data from this this multi-center clinical trial and it shows a distribution as we would examine of the patients maybe in our practice or the practices we're planning on going into where we really get differential responses to therapies 
 so this is essentially a graphic that displays the proportion of patients okay so going up to a 100 percent of the patients versus the percent osseous defect fill for this regenerative treatment 
 and so what you can see either using a standard of care or two different bone grafting biomaterials 
 there was more predictability if you will in this green group in terms of more of the patients showing better regeneration 
 however there is a subset of patients at the very bottom where these patients didn't have any you know the result was really negative whereas you can also see in the control there was a large group of patients that performed very well 
 so you know why do these patients respond differently 
 what what are some of the reasons for this and is there a way for us to customize our treatments that we deliver 
 and so so much in dentistry because we do tend to follow the surgical model of healthcare delivery we will either blame the patient in their compliance or we will blame you know the practitioner they don't have the hands that i have in terms of actually delivering this care 
 and certainly these are factors compliance are going to modulate a great deal the clinician skill is going to have a big role 
 it might have been the targeting of the drug or device within that particular defect or much of it might be based on the patient's inherent ability to respond to this particular treatment 
 and so some patients may have a much better response than his doctor has we're showing some patients are just incapable of responding to a specific drug because they don't express the receptor to enable them to have a robust response to that drug 
 so a large part of what i will be discussing this afternoon is is on saliva diagnostic testing 
 on how we might be able to now start using these rapid diagnostics for the identification of disease 
 we might be able to get a better handle on clinical response identifying risk that will then affect our prognosis 
 you know part of our initial exam developing a diagnosis and then developing a prognosis to say in the treatment planning how is this patient going to respond 
 also we can look at susceptibility and this becomes very challenging because it does intersect with environmental and compliance related aspects 
 this could be patients who may have a specific genetic profile but they're infected with other types of pathogens that gonna put them at greater risk for disease 
 and then also looking at the different drug targets doctor hassel has given some examples 
 so this particular topic oftentimes when you hear a presentation about diagnostics you know how how are we actually going to use these diagnostic tests in our practices 
 and so it becomes very difficult because in general in dentistry we don't have very orderly protocols that are standardized for us to deliver care 
 and so how is this going to help me deliver better care to the patient and so you know one very broad concept on how these tests can be used could be from a simple public health standpoint where we are able to identify those patients at highest risk 
 and do massive screening and then help bring those patients to the clinic for them to get a more in-depth evaluation 
 example in oral pathology could be the screening and identification of salivary il 8 that might predispose these patients to squamous cell carcinoma 
 and then they need to go to the oral pathologist for an exam and then maybe eventually a biopsy that is evaluated to really determine is that a true local you know oral cancer 
 so these technologies i'm gonna give you some examples now but you know this intercess- intersection between dentistry and engineering and the life sciences there are many different platforms for disease detection that are quite of that are becoming available 
 and this was actually a report on the use of potentially the use of an ipad or and iphone that you can actually drop saliva on to this device as a pseudo-lab-on-a-chip device 
 for the capacitance of that saliva that drops onto the these touch screens can actually then identify the capacitance of different types of microbial species so it could actually differentiate the quantity of microbes 
 it's it's very early stage i don't think we're gonna be using it you know in spitting on our screens anytime soon but we're gonna have devices that can do multiple functions 
 so as was just mentioned in the previous talk about you know the cautionary tales of some of this the genetic testing 
 actually when doctor mccauley asked me to give this presentation i've been aware of this technology and actually just for fun i decided to have my genome evaluated using this saliva test which actually has now gone through several iterations 
 and this is basically a very easy to use genetic test that you know the disclaimer on this is that it's only for research purposes it is not connected to anything that a healthcare practitioner is using currently 
 however i gotta i must say when i got the results back i mean i did have a little bit of a drop in my blood pressure just waiting to see what was going to come out from this 
 but as such it's a very easy to use test kit where you log on to this online then you receive a sample test kit 
 you you provide about 2 mls of saliva there're some different protease inhibitors that are put into this concoction it's mailed off and then you get the results in about 6 to 8 weeks 
 so these these tests are being used actually quite often this was from the new york times a couple of years ago where they were having a saliva party 
 and these are people with in the background sipping champagne and having a wine and cheese tasting and then spitting over in the other side giving up their saliva that then they were going to get their genomes evaluated 
 so when i received the results actually it comes back and there is a component of it in terms of ancestral painting and it looks at the haplogroups of both your mother and your father 
 and you know my mother was primarily irish and my father from southern italy area and so there was you know these these test kit sort of really provide very general identification of regions such as europe africa and asia 
 and so at least i was the composition of me was what i thought it was but you never know 
 and then then it starts to have this report that comes out that identifies multiple genes multiple risk factors for a variety of diseases 
 and doctor roberts he's gonna go into some of this interpretation and that's what much of the caution is of these specific results 
 and so this is an example of some areas that i was at decreased risk for and much of this in terms of confidence so for the students learning about evidence-based dentistry evidence-based medicine 
 this does in its own way look at a hierarchy of evidence in terms of multiple randomized controlled trials meta-analyses or very large clinical studies being a higher confidence for a an end-point 
 whereas then they also do all kinds of other exploratory and earlier stage less confident results 
 and so it's for those students in my lab it says i'm at decreased risk for alzheimer's if you're wondering 
 and then it has then it goes into several other areas that have much less confidence 
 and i think this is in terms of the education piece you know there are reports that come back for other diseases that there might be a concern so for example longevity 
 it tells me to see a report because it's telling me i'm actually probably not gonna be a centurion 
 you know i'm there are a variety of different risk factors 
 but i if we just take one for tooth development for example what is nice is that there are links then to the references that are then related to this particular gene and so in this case this is a single nucleotide polymorphism that is associated with t- with either supernumerary teeth or missing teeth 
 and so this is just an example based on a very large study and you can even link to this open access article that shows that there were just over 8000 patients and they had looked at the risk of having supernumerary teeth or not 
 in this particular case i was going to based on my profile i was only going i was gonna have a normal number of teeth 
 so these these technologies have some value in terms of what is available out there 
 but obviously they're going to be a lot of ramifications on how they're used later in practice 
 okay so as we think about now just some some of the most common examples where saliva diagnostics have been used in dentistry 
 these are that three areas periodontal disease oral cancer and dental caries 
 however i don't mean to be limiting in that it is really being applied to all areas of dentistry and these were just some of the lower hanging fruit that have been evaluated in several different situations so 
 if we think about in terms of periodontal disease evaluation in terms of a chronic disease if used it as a chronic disease model itself there are several junction points where diagnostic testing can be quite valuable 
 at the early stage in the genetic evaluation just like what i showed you there may be genetic test for disease that come out 
 it doesn't really address the epigenetic changes eric had a really great question because chronic diseases are very susceptible to epigenetic changes that are really going to affect the phenotype 
 and then we have the biological onset of the disease this might be at the microscopic level it's sub-clinical 
 and you know how can we identify that very early carious lesion or the initiation of periodontal disease 
 our detection tests we hope are very close to the biological onset but not always so sometimes they're more closer to the actual clinical measures the radiograph the increased pocket depth the bleeding these sorts of overt signs 
 and so what we wanna do is develop tests that don't just corroborate what we already see clinically but might help us screen patients more rapidly 
 and so this then leads into the development of more rapid point-of-care diagnostics where we can move beyond the conventional methods that we've used before that are very important for validation 
 but now starting to exploit many of the different molecular techniques that will help us do a very rapid assessment that may be able to be done at the chair side 
 to identify those patients at risk for disease and give us more of a real time assessment of what's going on and this is where many of the protein biomarkers have been used 
 so they can be used in in you know in periodontal practices i mentioned screening monitoring dental hygienists in terms of supportive periodontal therapy visits identifying those patients that are undergoing disease progression 
 identification of teeth that are at high risk for future progression and maybe you remove this pier abutment tooth for this bridge because it doesn't have a good prognosis and then lastly diagnosis of very specific diseases 
 so one of the things that we have an opportunity to do is within periodontics of the localized periodontal lesion we know that plaque biofilms elicit a host immune response and then there's a whole cascade of events in response to that microbial colonization 
 and it depends on the patient in terms of the release of different tissue destructive molecules associated with disease progression 
 and so you know there's been a lot of work done in the saliva area in terms of identifying many of these mediators that are released from the saliva many of them very large molecular weight molecules other of them smaller molecules that may or may not be associated with disease 
 and so i'll show you one example that the research team at mcohr the michigan center for oral health research has been involved with a collaboration with the department of energy group sandia national labs and mcohr 
 and this is really working in the development of a handheld diagnostic that could be used to put in a couple of drops of saliva to then give an output of a rapid diagnosis in a matter of minutes versus what i call the brute force method in the lab that might take a day or two or sometimes longer 
 so this is an example in terms of a proof-of-principle 
 where we essentially took we examined one specific mediator of disease matrix metalloproteinase released from neutrophils connected with periodontal disease 
 and we took a group of healthy dental hygienists and than we took a group of diseased patients then looked at the use of this prototype diagnostic to predict disease 
 and so this is the internal workings of the device and so it basically has an a sample collection area a filtration of the large molecular weight proteins and then a very small volume of saliva will will traverse this device and then in a matter of 4 to 10 minutes getting an output in terms of the level of a specific biomarker 
 so it is a handheld device it's it's fairly large of minutes it's got 8 different double a batteries and as it's not quite as small as this but it still could be at the chair side 
 so this is an example of of fluorescein-labeled saliva that is put into this device and essentially one only needs a couple of about 50 nanoliters or so of saliva to go into this device 
 it traverses through the device and then it was benchmarked to a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay an eliza from the laboratory 
 and what you can see on this plot is basically using the micro-capillary electrophoresis compared to the eliza they related very well so this test was just as good as the brute force method 
 and then if you look at the groups of patients i got to mention the healthy the moderate disease and severe periodontitis using this detection device you could see that there is a strong readout for those patients who have elevated levels of one of these different biomarkers mmp-8 
 so and this is the size of the these chips that can be dropped in and out of the device to then you can drop in the protein of interest to measure that within the the fluid 
 so we've been able to use this then for the evaluation of multiple different biomarkers 
 and so now you start to get a greater robustness in terms of using different components of the disease process microbial pathogens 
 using different markers of inflammation and then markers of tissue destruction in the same readout and so these are what are called oral c-curves in terms of the the false positive rate and the true positive rate and so these curves are basically as you go to the upper left-hand corner you're getting a stronger result 
 and so a greater predictability in terms of an odds ratio in these 2 cases of 10 and 24 increased risk of periodontal disease if a patient has for example increased levels of matrix metalloproteinase 8 and they're infected with treponema denticola a pathogen highly associated with periodontitis 
 right and so that's just taking a snapshot and we already have the tools available to identify you know if someone has periodontal disease or not i think as clinicians we know this 
 but then how do we identify those people who are gonna undergo progression 
 and certainly there are a lot of factors that dictate that 
 but this was part of doing a longitudinal study where we took a 100 patients and then we followed them for one year 
 and during that one year period at 2 month intervals they were they did not receive any treatment so they were we were disease monitoring 
 so from an ethical standpoint if someone underwent progression then they received local treatment but it wasn't more than 2 millimeters of of tissue loss we we monitored them through the study 
 and so after that 6 months of observation then we delivered care 
 measured progressive bone loss progressive soft tissue loss 
 so this may not project very well my apologies 
 this is just a patient flow that demonstrates the the disposition of the patients throughout the trial and the the numbers of patients that were screened and out of the 100 that were entered 83 completed the 6 month portion of the study that i'll show you the results on 
 so basically these 4 panels demonstrate radiographic soft tissue and inflammatory markers over time 
 so again disease monitoring the first 6 months and then treatment at 6 months and then we looked at what happened after those first 6 months 
 and so as as predicted the periodontal disease didn't get better over time it tended to progress and then when the patients received treatment there were improvements steady improvements in those particular cases 
 so then the part that we are more interested in is to then look at the different biomarkers 
 the the signatures if you will of disease over time and then looking at the real time assessment of disease 
 and so we looked at 30 different biomarkers but there was 6 of them that were most clos- closely evaluated mmp-8 mmp-9 osteoprotegerin and calprotectin 
 and so what we're able to do is that these different biomarkers respond differentially obviously to disease progression and then resolution of disease 
 and so then we were able to take this information and put it together and then connect it with the clinical outcomes 
 you know did a patient get better or did a patient get worse following the treatment 
 so i'll i'll put you through this is a cluster analysis that then puts together clinical microbiological protein biomarker and serum assessments of disease 
 and essentially if a patient had this particular profile of elevated and reduced levels of these particular biomarkers and it's probably not so critically important that we go through each one of them except to say that there was a signature if a patient had this profile they tended to undergo disease progression 
 whereas if a patient had the bottom profile which you could see that this was really suggestive even in the face of a microbial challenge without treatment these patients did better 
 and they either remain stable or even slightly improved so these are the patients who are at lower risk for disease progression 
 so that was an example with periodontal disease and that flowchart just demonstrate it's very difficult to get the specific types of patients periodontal disease not as common 
 and so one of our graduate students in the periodontics program angie lee actually embarked on a much more common oral disease that is gingivitis 
 and what she did is look at genetic microbiological and protein biomarkers that could predict whether or not somebody had an exacerbated gingival inflammatory profile 
 so this uses the classical experimental gingivitis model where patients cease oral hygiene for a period of 21 days and then you watch the development of the plaque biofilm you watch the development of the inflammation 
 and surprisingly this study was very easy to enroll 
 it was the patients were paid a stipend to enroll and we've got a very large number of college students who enrolled in this study 
 and essentially they undergo a pretrial phase they're brought to a stage of oral health and then they cease all oral hygiene for 21 days then they undergo a prophylaxis 
 and so what we did was we stratified these patients based on a susceptibility factor that i'll talk about a little bit later called a susceptibility factor for a polymorphism of the interleukin 1 beta gene 
 and it's within the promoter region and i'll show you a little bit more about that later 
 patients divided by that factor and then we looked at their progression of disease 
 and so this il-1 polymorphism what you can see here is within the promoter region there are 2 locations this il-1 a and il-1 b components of that gene 
 and if there's a polymorphism in those locations that can be picked up by this rapid and there is a saliva test then the patients are identified as high risk for developing inflammation 
 and this is connected with other chronic inflammatory diseases such as crohn's disease inflammatory bowel and some of these other types of diseases 
 and so what it was able to then be used for is identifying patients who are at higher risk for over the 21 days to display a gingival index of 2 or 3 so that's almost spontaneous bleeding 
 whereas other patients who really don't and we see them people who don't brush their teeth and they they still do pretty good they do well 
 and so you know how do you discriminate between those patients 
 and so we looked at and this was a collaboration with the forsyth institute looking at each one of these time points 
 it's not so important i know you can't read the different pathogens there 
 but looking at 40 different pathogens and then you basically have a fingerprint of the plaque biofilm on the plaque biofilm on the tooth root surface 
 and you can see the blue line is the genetic polymorphism and then the orange line is the negative the il-1 of the patients who don't have the polymorphism 
 and there was really no difference 
 and these studies usually with polymorphisms you need large numbers of patients to see something 
 but what was interesting was that those patients who had the propensity to develop the inflammatory phenotype 
 these patients tended to have high levels of interleukin 8 matrix metalloproteinase 8 and f nucleatum polymorphum 
 and you can see that these patients were at increased risk of d- of displaying that profile 
 so again just another example of using these approaches to predict an oral condition 
 so the other area of oral cancer and actually that topic was very well covered by doctor hassel i'm just going to give you a vignette of how saliva diagnostics are being used for oral cancer 
 and again the same paradigm in terms of screening and then bringing the patient to the clinician surgeon for histopathological evaluations is the real the main concept 
 and so if we look at the disease prevalence in terms of you know it's a cancer even though the proximity and being able to visualize it the outcomes are still not outstanding in terms of oral cancer survival 
 so there is a very important need for the development of oral cancer diagnostics 
 and so one research group at the ucla school of dentistry david wong's group has developed a platform that actually is readily accessible and he shared these slides with me he calls it the salivaomics knowledge base 
 and he's he's received quite a bit of funding from the nidcr in the development of this database and then just very recently he has received funding as part of a u-award that will be collaborating with him on to look at a variety of diseases in terms of development of chair-side diagnostics for oral cancer detection 
 and so very similar to the other type of diagnostic i showed you 
 they have now developed a platform at ucla were they have these different cassettes that can be dropped into this device 
 again for a rapid evaluation of a variety of diseases oral cancer as one of them using il-8 but also for pancreatic cancer diabetes screening and others 
 and so what we're starting to see is that many of these different diagnostics are coming down the pipeline 
 dental caries 
 this is an area in the last several years there has been a lot of progress being made in the development of different diagnostics i mean we've known for a long time the importance of diet and oral hygiene in terms of dental caries 
 however it also has been shown by a variety of of researchers as well as in this room in terms of genetics of dental caries 
 and so with the use of genome-wide association studies or gwas screening now there is a very robust ability to identify a variety of different snps there are associated with disease and so this particular study from the group at the university of pittsburgh what they have been able to identify is their predictions from this large study was that 40 to 60 percent of dental caries is really associated with genetics the genetics of the disease that's what they believe from their study 
 and the other patient compliance aspects diet making up the other part 
 it's very similar to periodontal disease 
 genetics appears to be responsible for about 50 percent of periodontal disease as well 
 and the use of taste genes this was i thought quite quite interesting in terms of certain patients have a predilection for wanting to go after the sugary foods and so the same group actually identified these taste genes that put patients at you know they can't control themselves in terms of wanting the the sugary foods to to put them at higher risk for dental caries and so 
 there's been a large amount of work done in this area 
 and so this is just an example from that large gwas study identifying on a variety of different chromosomal locations different snps that are putting patients at greater risk for the development of dental caries 
 treatment planning 
 i will show you this is the last part of my presentation as as we look at the delivery of care for our patients the treatment planning aspects i think are are very important and so 
 if i give this example and i think it's important in clinical care delivery obviously the compliance patients control of oral hygiene measures if we talk about periodontal disease again using it as a model and really combining the role of the bacterial challenge and then the host response that is the makeup of the patient that may have either been dictated by genetics or epigenetics which also i'm skipping over that for this talk 
 but epigenetic changes clearly have a very big role in periodontal disease just due to you know you've got decades of pathogens bathing the soft tissues and after a period of time we know there's a lot of dna hypermethylation around the teeth themselves 
 and so if we really look at these 2 these 2 aspects and coming back to these different either polymorphisms which there have been at least 80 connected with risk of periodontal disease and the il-1 gene variations have been the most well studied 
 so gave the example of gingival inflammation but also very related to periodontal disease progression 
 and so this is probably i think the best study that was done this is a group of patients in sweden they're part of a very large maintenance practice so very homogeneous patient population and as ken kornman likes to call these are a 100 percent viking population of patients 
 these these individuals were followed for a period of time from 1988 to 1998 
 they all had risk factors for periodontal disease and i think this was quite interesting 
 as he looked at those patients who don't smoke and we know smoking is a big risk factor for periodontal disease also negative for the polymorphism il-1 they have lower disease progression if we look at an output of tooth loss 
 you can measure attachment level but if you start losing teeth that's a very that's that's the best thing we have in dentistry to mortality tooth mortality 
 and looking at what happens there versus these patients that either have 1 of the risk factors either a non-smoker in il-1 positive or a smoker in il-1 negative 
 increased risk however when you combine these 2 il-1 and a smoker then you can see these patients are at a big risk for developing progressive disease and eventually tooth loss 
 so this then led into a collaboration with interleukin genetics 
 ken kornman chief scientific officer at interleukin genetics and he is actually recently our #* for visiting professor and a #* of our perio program 
 we've and they just put out this press release today just coincidentally of the completion of a very large study that we did in collaboration with interleukin 
 to now connect genetic evaluation and see if it can relate to personalized healthcare and how you would deliver something very simple such as maintenance therapy to patients to patients globally not just patients with periodontitis but pat- the standard 6 month profi 
 and we don't even know why we use 6 months right 
 i mean it's the toothbrush companies set up this paradigm of 6 months and it's worked very well but we know it's overkill for some patients and some patients that's not enough maintenance care 
 and so if we can use that model that you just saw from the the the swedish study then we want to look at okay larger patient populations can that help us customize our care 
 so the primary objective of this investigation was to then look at evaluate dental patients who are classified as low-risk so we looked at a group of individuals between the ages of 30 and 50 who essentially had no periodontal procedures so we looked at claims data 
 right and then look at practitioners clinical decision making so we had the the end the end results were tooth loss or patients who received advanced periodontal procedures 
 did they have scaling and root planing did they receive periodontal surgery and then the outcome is tooth loss 
 to see what happens in terms of tooth loss 
 so we recruited patients and basically targeted a group of individuals these were actually the michigan teachers association primarily now retired teachers and they're a very compliant group we found out 
 and they send us letters all the time if we do a misstep in terms of materials we send them it's a so 
 and what has been interesting is that so we stratified the recruitment of the patients based on these different risk factors and then we also had 15 years of data 
 that these patients came to the dental office at least once or twice a year for 15 years 
 so we're really looking at a very well documented patient population 
 so the group at the michigan center for oral health research then worked with michr and we basically contacted a large number of patients and then we sent out 9900 patients agreed to participate in this study 
 and then out of those 9900 i'll show you the the the metrics in terms of what we received 
 but we would send them basically demographic information for them to provide us as well as a dna sample that originally can be used to look at this one study question and eventually you may be able to look through gwas screening other different snps associated with periodontal disease 
 then the patients they did these swabs themselves at home and then sent the samples to us 
 so out of the 32000 patients originally consented i'll show you the number that agreed to participate so about just over a third of them agreed but then once we sent them the kit then it was about another half of them once they really started seeing the genetic information there some of them you know were still unwilling to participate or just didn't submit the kits 
 but we received just over 54 100 of these and then what we'll be doing now in the next few months is now answering those study questions to determine whether or not that has a risk so there'll be there'll be more come on that to see how that can work but that's really in essence an example of of a way using it for personalized healthcare 
 so my last three slides really thinking that as we bring this into perspective looking at saliva diagnostics we may be able to be able may be able to have something set up where we can do chair-side based diagnostics in the clinical practice for a rapid readout of information 
 and as we move forward really these are some of the key issues and i think that this will end up being a good segway for doctor roberts because there are all kinds of science policy issues and things of that nature they're are really going to be important for us to assess in terms of how we're going to use this information 
 obviously we have to have good tests they have to be predictable and they will not make it to the chair side unless they perform in that manner we have to connect this with education from several sides in terms of the counseling 
 there are different biobanks that are being set up 
 #* has biobanks also the uk has a large bio bank of saliva serum looking at health outcomes of patients of the united kingdom this will be valuable 
 and then lastly confidentiality 
 so with that i like to thank you for your attention and i also like to thank the groups of from our lab group and all those at michigan center for oral health research thank you 
 material sciences so well really like to thank you for sharing your genetic data with us because can confirmed what many of us knew virtue all along and that that is indeed you are better than average and the categories 
 so i was watching and thinking through presentation i think of other potential really fabulous things do these diagnostics 
 but that i was more in our typical dental practices all these things are fee for services and 
 i thought maybe is can i we even be the pay for this practices whereas it perhaps fits more medical model where a physician can do this and have insurance reimburse so even though our patients generally see 
 a dentist more often is a physician well our patients have got the physician to get told they need to see the dentist or how you see this of 
 working 
 also good questions the first one you notice i only showed the parts was a decreased risk of denture is a longer list 
 of example increased risk for should make it through this presentation but know how much farther 
 but the question that to provide in terms of how we pay for 
 this health care within dentistry and i think at a great question because diagnostics have not fared well 
 in dentistry get as we look at medical model surgical model because we really are still overall situated and very much of a restorative type of 
 modus operandi in terms of how we deliver care diagnostics have not been accepted by thirdparty payers at this point overall it's the biopsy in oral pathology but beyond that is a challenge because even if you look at that personalized medicine study were doing in there are no codes that we have in dentistry for diagnosis so all that information is missing and so we need to begin there terms of valuing a diagnosis and capturing that information 
 and then you know incorporating that into the dental office know how we do that doesn't need to be a partnership in terms of policy making because the professional community has to embrace this we have to embrace these new technologies 
 some of the mouth to be taken with a grain saw but in how we pay for them will be a big challenge they will have to be fairly inexpensive or connected directly with the treatment so there might be customized treatments where there as a 
 if going to receive this treatment in to have this test on the see okay what dosing what 
 what type of material may be that you'll receive but the cost structure has been a challenge because in dentistry we give away a lot of our exams relative to treatments right 
 diagnostic visit i think by a physician is much higher for a maybe a shorter treatment time that we charge so there are a lot of issues i think from the policy side that you bring up thick 
 and i think the doctor roberts will touch on that better how can be 
 pressure the discussion 
 and i can suggest source of things that are currently available in this least the state of michigan regarding reimbursement if your licensed practitioner 
 and you have a procedure that to do within the scope of your licensure there is no limit that the state of michigan has on who is a provider can receive reimbursement 
 so your is a mechanism for dentist to collect medical reimbursement monies for procedures for which there are licensed to do so there is no restriction if this is an accepted procedure your licensed practitioner is covered under your licensure 
 yeah so everything that i i've presented right now i think these diagnostics we haven't had them approved by regulatory agencies is that part of your question in terms of the approval process 
 so today his diet these saliva based diagnostics are not approved and so in terms of the trajectory to have these presented to the after actually is a bit more of a straightforward 
 process for after the approval there have been a few diagnostic test approved by the after 
 but they're no longer available so one of them was a diagnostic test for periodontal disease using an enzyme called elastase there was another one using an enzyme called ast 
 aspartate aminotransferase those two enzymebased tests were out on the market for a couple of years but then 
 when went off the market there is one on the market in terms of the aisle one genetic test that is after approved and that is available and so that is available also didn't show there say microbial test 
 that looks at periodontal pathogens and that is available but then maybe answering your question more directly know can use that to say an evidencebased manner you should treat your patients based off of this it's more of 
 directional information on the parradile pathogen so a dna probe analysis that's used in combination with the genetic test 
 the varied x corporation does have an appt cam test that is recently made available it's licensed and it is a if the approved test and also is specific for particular agent so the direction for that application to the the following the 
 the varied exmodel may be an appropriate approach to 
 questions first say very low risk for menopause 
 curious about composition of saliva on the parotid gland versus submandibular versus whole saliva that spit out initially 
 that change these diagnostic tests and how these practitioners supposed to manage that patients with stone 
 where we getting as 
 we state that in terms of change understand secreted biomarkers that and it's like if you patient spit 
 other secretions 
 compared to say milking the parotid duct pure form is test that so that's a great question in terms of 
 the sources of the saliva they're used some people have looked at a specific glands themselves some of these tests are being called saliva diagnostics are basically a buccal swab that was being used for the 
 the interleukin one assessment and so i there is no answer to that in terms of what is the best biomarker because that the different sources for example the periodontal disease using a parrot 
 a protein biomarker you want that you see are that's the main the main proteins that actually appear in the saliva associate with inflammation is based off of that serum ultra filtrate if you will of the gingival crevicular fluid 
 a larger a lot of those very large proteins are all derived from the gingival crevicular fluid so some people have looked at separating out even looking at stimulated unstimulated saliva 
 taking from the parotid duct submandibular and it depends on the disease and what you use 
 i think what has happened is again there's been this thrust to develop rapid easy to use types of diagnostic so that twenty three and may test is really one that looks 
 can i you know is a very simple collection method to evaluate and so for dna that ends up being a very good method just whole saliva and most everything i showed you was from whole saliva versus the buccal swab you'll get more of a cellular 
 type of collection so it's it's really specific but it's a good question and i this year actually has put together a working group to actually develop standardized methodologies on the collections of all these types of fluids i'm participating on that working group 
 and it's it's very challenging to come up surface pretty standardized you see everything 
 across the field so from a methodological approach is it's a great question that really needs to be sorted out 
 thank you
