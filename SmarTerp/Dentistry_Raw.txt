thanks everybody for coming 
 i just wanna say i've been coming to these things i think i missed the first one and it is my favorite place in the world to be and it's really because of you guys so let's give you guys a big hand 
 alright so we #* there's two of us talking so there's not a lot of time so we're gonna do like little ted talks hopefully mine doesn't turn into a ted geisel talk 
 for those of you know don't know who that is is doctor seuss 
 so okay first of all our friend al danenberg he been ill he would have loved to be here he can't make it 
 so you know our hearts and prayers are are with him 
 i just wanted to start by saying you know he was kind of my inspiration for what i'm talking about today 
 so currently were doing a study designed by doctor al 
 its a we're gonna look for 50 subjects with measurable gum disease 
 we're going to do swabs actually mitoswabs to check their mitochondrial function and oral microbiome swabs as well 
 6 weeks of either a placebo or a probiotic with vitamin k2 double check the inflammation and also the mitocon- mitochondrial function and the oral microbiome 
 we suspect we're gonna see changes in the mitochondrial function 
 and the oral microbiome is probably going to change because we're affecting the gi microbiome so that's sort of the incentive for what i'm gonna talk about today 
 alright that's my fake book i haven't written that carb mouth maybe one day 
 so the two things that i'm gonna talk about today we're gonna do an examination of the relationship between the oral and general gut dysbiosis both of which seemed to be initiated by the introduction of dense acellular carbohydrates 
 and then i'm gonna get into an explora- an exploration of some of the critical factors in the etiology of caries and periodontitis 
 okay so 23 centuries ago aristotle tried to describe foods that caused cavities 
 and then you look down at the guy in the bottom and that's about where we've gotten 
 it's still very very confusing 
 here is an example if you look at the foods on the right you know which one of those is actually gonna cause more cavities 
 is it the lollipop with all the sugar or is it the pretzel 
 and there are factors that i would say both cause cavities but one might be worse than the other and it's kind of a mystery 
 and we'll get into that a little bit later 
 so here's the general formula okay 
 we have fermentable carbohydrates plus cariogenic mouth bacteria so cariogenic just means cavity causing and susceptible teeth and then that gets you your risk for cavities 
 that's really a bit of an oversimplification so throughout this little presentation i'm gonna be clarifying that 
 okay so this is where we're gonna end up with i'm not gonna keep the slide up there for too long and come back to it reconstruct it later on 
 alright so fermentable carbohydrates 
 all carbohydrates are fermentable okay 
 they can all be metabolized for energy by microorganisms 
 so we've been on this planet for 3 million years or so 
 we've only just recently gotten cavities and we've been eating fermentable carbohydrates for a long time so that's incorrect 
 okay whole foods it's interesting that have a picture of of an acorn 
 you don't think of people as eating acorns but we see squirrels eating them all the time 
 and if you look at that thing there's a lot of wood in there as they got to get through the wood in order to get to the carbohydrate inside 
 so arguably a diet that's a whole foods diet it's gonna be much better for you 
 and i have a study down there that if you're kind of curious i have it 
 you can refer to that or you can read this book tyron finds corn in his #* 
 that's pretty good explanation right there 
 you wrap stuff up in cellulose it's hard to break down we don't get a sugar bomb in our mouth 
 okay so dense acellular carbohydrate right this is what we're looking at sugar all that sort of stuff by studying how ultra-processing changes the properties of whole foods and how these foods affect the gut microbiome more useful dietary guidelines can be made 
 and for those of you who don't know what dense acellular carbohydrates are there's some of them 
 doesn't have to just be wheat flour could be tapioca starch 
 anytime you take the carbs outside of a plant cell it's a dangerous thing 
 okay so plaque acid dense acellular carbohydrate and tooth decay 
 the mechanism is is this you get the acellular carbohydrates in the mouth 
 the bacteria in the mouth ferment the stuff 
 it lowers the ph and the ph dissolves the minerals in the teeth it's that simple 
 @void 
 and when we're talking about gum disease you have plaque making lipopolysaccharides from the dense acellular carbohydrates and you get gum disease 
 lipopolysaccharides are also known as endotoxins okay so on a local level they're toxic to the gums 
 and this is with the introduction of dense acellular carbohydrates 
 endotoxins 
 okay so humans are quite unique primates and lagomorphs those those are like hares and rabbits do have salivary amylase but humans have multiple copies 
 okay some people have i think 2 copies and i think you can have up to about 15 
 so when you're eating that pretzel okay we've all done this you can't touch your teeth together for for sometimes 20 minutes to 1 hour because there's there's all that doughy stuff stuck to your teeth and i think the the starch and flowers amylopectin if i'm not mistaken and that's considered to be a lower cariogenetic substance however it stays there for a long time and now your saliva and especially if you have more amylase you used to call it ptyalin you're gonna be breaking that stuff down into simple sugars 
 so what's worse a lollipop that maybe sticks to your teeth but it melts off pretty quickly or maybe a pretzel that stays there for a long time these are interesting questions 
 so more amylase does equal more sugar okay we've #* scott touched upon that 
 so basically you know salivary amylase becomes a problem when we eat that processed carbohydrates 
 so even if they're complex carbohydrates they can become simple sugars in the mouth 
 the bacteria can actually hijack the amylase to help to get more sugar from the starch 
 and they also use it sort of as a matrix to develop the biofilm 
 and and also the bacteria do make their own amylase as well 
 so all of this stuff causes a lowering of the ph an acidic environment and basically melting away of the teeth 
 okay so weston a. price okay john yudkin thomas l. cleave these are all sort of pioneers that spoke about the introduction of modern foods and you know what it did to all of us so you know you see that guy on the bottom there with all of his tattoos but if he didn't have his tattoos his fleshiness is giving away what really what he's doing isn't it 
 that's another way of putting it forrest gump was pretty smart 
 but to get technical and there is a lot of mechanisms that go on this just happens to be one 
 so basically de lartigue was a bit of more elaborate in in implicating the vagus nerve leptin resistance blunting you know the satiety and they're a lot of mechanisms and we just i don't have enough time to really get into that today okay 
 so the present hypothesis suggests that it is a diet of high density carbohydrates that produce inflammatory microbiotal changes in both the mouth and the gut 
 when i was putting together this presentation i was maybe put a picture of the gut 
 and it's interesting half of the pictures you pull up start here they don't include the mouth and it's amazing to me 
 we already talked about salivary amylase or breaking down carbohydrates in the mouth we're digesting right here okay 
 so when you start with this dysbiosis of the mouth with the introduction of dense acellular carbohydrates you're gonna get inflammation of the gums you're gonna get your teeth melting away 
 what happens to the food after you swallow it 
 last time i checked it goes down somewhere and it stays in your body for a long time 
 so there is a definite change in the microbiome of the gut 
 some people argue the gut microbiome changes first some people argue the mouth microbiome changes first chicken or the egg i don't know to me it doesn't really seem that important 
 but to me when you introduce this dysbiosis to your mouth rest assured excuse me it's in your gut and this little diagram i had to pencil in the gum disease it wasn't even on there people just seem to forget about the mouth 
 but all of these things occur these are low levels of chronic inflammation that we have in our bodies because of dense acellular carbohydrate changing microbiome 
 okay so here we go dysbiosis of the gut pretty much means dysbiosis of the oral cavity 
 the present hypothesis suggests that in parallel with bacterial effects of sugars on dental and periodontal health acellular flowers sugars and processed foods produce an inflammatory microbiota via the upper gastrointestinal tract 
 that was said by our friend doctor ian spreadbury maybe 3 or 4 years ago i don't know if any of you guys saw that lecture go back to it it's worth watching 
 it's on youtube i believe 
 okay so now i'm gonna go through a couple of studies and there's really not a lot of research out there and it's really kind of all over the place 
 i'm gonna go through a few studies that are gonna connect the oral oral microbiome with gut dysbiosis 
 so in this study here they did a bacterial analysis of obese women and 98 point 4 percent of them this the oral microbiome ha- just the presence of one bacteria at levels greater than 1 point 05 percent of the total bacterial colony was indicative of obesity 
 so i mean that's close to a 100 percent 
 they could find one germ in the mouth and predict whether the person was obese so that's pretty good 
 and i think more research needs to be done excuse me along these lines 
 we may be able to determine a lot of things just by a simple oral swab it's really easy to do 
 you know an oral microbiome swab test it's a heck of a lot easier than a stool test i assure you anybody here ever do a stool test 
 not so much fun 
 okay two more studies 
 results find that oral buccal so that's the cheek microbiome reflects differences in the microbial ecology of participants with ibs that are overweight 
 okay so they could find patterns of overweight people with ibs in the mouth 
 the second one the one in the bottom there 
 mounting evidence supports a major role of the systemic spread of oral commensals and pathogens to distant body sites causing extra-oral infections and inflammation 
 what does that mean 
 so the the germs in the mouth are getting into the body so you know we're led to believe that the stomach acid is supposed to be high enough to kill all of the germs 
 maybe maybe not 
 i think that s- excuse me some of them do get through 
 but there are other ways that these critters can get through 
 if you've ever seen severe gum disease the the the gums are just bloody and not looking too good 
 so really what you have from this oral dysbiosis is is a leaky mouth okay 
 so that's a way that the lipopolysaccharides by the way are gonna get into the bloodstream right from the mouth 
 and now you got low levels of chronic inflammation throughout the body 
 and you're sick 
 i think i've got 1 or 2 more 
 okay so this was in pediatric crohn's disease patients and this one it was a little bit more general they just found that there was a decrease in the diversity of the oral microbiome in this particular patients 
 and then one more in mice 
 they observed that mice that had colitis i think they induced it the composition of the bacteria present in the oral cavity and saliva changed as well 
 okay so we're we're seeing a pattern here where we can see changes in the bacteria of the mouth as they pertain to disease states so i think there's a lot of work that needs to be done here but this is really really really promising 
 so this is kind of my little pipe dream 
 you know for oral microbia- microbial analysis 
 could it be a proxy for a stool test 
 wouldn't that be nice 
 a proxy to determine whether you have other systemic diseases 
 early detection of gut dysbiosis before it happens 
 and of course maybe even if we find a couple of germs in there maybe it's gonna determine that you have some kind of gum disease or cavity if you don't watch out 
 so that's pretty cool stuff 
 @void 
 love yoda 
 okay so back to my formula 
 so we went over fermentable carbohydrates it's really dense acellular carbohydrates in my opinion excuse me 
 so the cariogenic mouth bacteria 
 i also have a problem with that because we all have cariogenic bacteria in our mouths right now 
 but we all aren't getting cavities right now so that's a little bit incorrect 
 and and here is a little proof so you cannot inherit cavity causing germs from your parents 
 we know this this has been discussed a thousand times at the ahs over the years 
 that you know when you go through the birth canal you get inundated with your mom's germs 
 so yeah most of us get our oral microbiome from our mothers and fathers but they can have mouths riddled with tooth decay and that's not necessarily what happens with the kids okay 
 so they did a twin study here and what they really determined it's it's the oral environment later on okay 
 so germs become cariogenic cavity causing because you change their environment which changes their behavior 
 the analogy that i like to use is you know we all have probably a good friend or two they're as nice as p- excuse me as nice as pie and then they get a couple of drinks and in a minute get real angry right 
 so yeah give them the wrong substrate and their behavior changed 
 and then you know as pertains to gum disease 
 i'm gonna get a little more involved with this in a minute but none of our paleolithic ancestors had tooth decay or gum disease we know this because there are thousands and thousands of fossilized skulls that we have available and i think kevin is gonna be probably talk more about that later 
 but we can study tartar and plaque that's thousands of years old paleo-microbiology it's kind of a cool thing 
 they can actually go in there and and look at the dna and and figure out what the bacterial colonies we had in our mouths years and years and years ago 
 so they found two changes 
 the first one was ten thousand years ago when we started farming and that's some pretty good dentistry over there for however many thousands of years ago that would be considered prosthetic dentistry for its day it's pretty good 
 but when we started taking carbohydrates out of the cell that's what we did when we started farming we introduced the dense acellular carbohydrates into our bodies 
 and this is the result 
 so what they saw was that there was an uptick of strep mutants that's one that c- that creates a lot of acid 
 the second change was during the industrial revolution because we further processed flowers and we added sugars 
 and you know this is one of the sufferers he had to get one tooth and and his dentures were not wooden by the way 
 okay i got to rush i have one minute left okay susceptible teeth 
 we all have susceptible teeth anybody can get a cavity anywhere anyhow 
 yes some people do have stronger teeth than others but it was never a factor in the paleolithic era 
 our teeth are plenty strong enough if we don't put this stuff in our bodies okay couple other things 
 frequency how often this stuff gets in the mouth is very important 
 frequency and sequence so baby bottle decay everybody know what that is 
 you can take very watered-down juice or even milk and lactose is actually very low on the cariogenic scale 
 but if the baby is suckling that thing all night long within weeks there will be no teeth left 
 it's it's unbelievable 
 okay and then retention we talk a little bit about that before when stuff sticks to your teeth 
 it's able to be broken down by our salivary amylase and also it's just there as a substrate for the bacteria in the mouth to do their dirty work okay 
 before when i showed you other different things ranging from candies i don't know bagels and pretzels 
 that's been looked at and what they've really determined is that consumers you know we really can't figure out which one is worse 
 is it the lollipop it's it's just it's it's a little too confusing but joe pesci put it better 
 all right the acorn got to get to the acorn 
 there were people fifteen thousand years ago that were in morocco northern morocco and they were eating acorns 
 and that's the teeth they got from it 
 they weren't using sugar 
 they figured out a way with stone tools i guess to refine the carbohydrates from acorns into acellular dense acellular carbohydrates and that's the result 
 not too good 
 so the paleo diet you know paleo cookies no no 
 okay real quick i got to go through this my time is up 
 this is the real formula dense acellular carbohydrate any oral microbiome we all have one you can not have one that's all you need you need teeth anybody here no teeth you're in the wrong r- lecture room 
 the food has to be retained on the teeth for a time because brushing and flossing works that's why we recommend it 
 the frequency we went over that and i don't have time to get into it but the quality of your saliva and your salivary flow is very very important 
 this is my future bestseller we got wheat belly and grain brain why not carb mouth that's really what it is if i had to simplify it i my time is brief you can i'll be happy to send these slides to you that's my email address that's my website i usually put up a blog once a week thank you 
 okay john lennon my favorite beatle 
 this is our second annual i'm i'm and kevin boyd by the way 
 pediatric dentist and a wannabe anthropologist not not quite yet there but in training 
 this is the second time we've done this last last year was sort of a hiatus and this year we're resuming it we don't have one of our founding members alvin 
 however he will be saying a few words to you in a minute but this is some his contributions to dentistry and to the paleo healthcare movement 
 it's al danenberg i wish i were there in person i'm here in video i'm here in spirit but unfortunately not in person 
 i have some medical issues that #are preventing me from# traveling 
 but i wanted to say a couple things 
 2 years ago the 2 docs and myself were part of the first dental panel that was presented at the ancestral health symposium and it was awesome 
 the audience loved it we had great questions and i'm sure this one is going to be even better 
 the most important thing today i think is that there's so much research that's going on with the gut microbiome the oral health and overall chronic disease and it's so intricately and intimately related 
 dentistry it's just the perfect profession to speak of these matters because who's the physician of the mouth dentists are 
 so if we can get the word out and p- and people understand how important the gut is to the mouth which is so critical to the rest of the body we are in great shape and we're making a real dent in the medical profession 
 have a great seminar i know you guys are gonna do a wonderful job 
 let me know how things go i am excited for you and i wish i were there but have a great one let me know take care 
 that's great so you know everybody here is so inspired 
 send him you know a note saying how you're glad to hear from him and we're gonna try to beam him in next year and just encourage him 
 you might you might actually help increase the quality and quantity of his life 
 this group means so much to him so glad we could do that it was nice that it turned out great 
 you just gave me that well okay that isn't working so let's try that 
 last year i did a similar thing 2 years ago and and scott and alvin that and i talked about the shrinking face and i wasn't quite as much as far i am in my research as i am now is that what affects the face affects the airway 
 and i'm gonna develop that concept a little bit 
 shortly after that montana meeting last year i went to salt lake city and spoke at the international society of evolution medicine and public health and developed this whole concept from them after this meeting 2 years ago so i this this group means a lot to me every time i come here just through networking and and speaking and the questions that it really helps me advance my own curiosity and things that i can contribute to the science at least in this lecture circuit 
 this is something that i took out in the lobby in bozeman montana 
 and that guess what is a habitual nose breather probably from birth and probably while mom was carrying this woman and man when they were babies 
 they also the mothers probably were nose breathers because we found out that just like the flight attendant says put the mask on yourself before you help your kid 
 the placenta is very selective for oxygen mom gets priority it's the only nutrient that mothers get priority for 
 'cause if a mom dies the baby dies so babies throughout our whole 300000 years of anatomically modern human history have learned in utero to to not only survive with low or to relative to you know what we get when we're in the outside world 
 but the the po2 in utero is actually thinner than the air on top of mount everest and actually a mile above mount everest and that that's a study that was done in the 18 hundreds by sir barcroft in england 
 why is this important why am i so intrigued about this michael mew is marianna evans is and there's several people that are really pursuing this because it not only makes a difference in how we look 
 but it makes a difference in how the brain grows and what we commonly call attention deficit disorder often is these kids early on before maybe they're diagnosed they have co-morbid malocclusion that can preclude them breathing habitually through their nose 
 so that's kind of the basis of the thesis that i'm working on 
 i'm a visiting scholar at penn and i'm also now an assistant professor of anthropology at the university of arkansas under jerry rose mentoring a phd student who wants to she's been time at my office looking at my data on how i clinically apply anthropological theories to clinical practice 
 and also that's what we are doing at the university of pennsylvania so as last year we we were 2 years ago we had steven #* who helped us moderate and brett is helping and we've got all kind of help today that i didn't wasn't aware of so thank you all for for all the support 
 next month in boston i'll be speaking at the oral medicine tactic- toxicology group which is you know i can't even pronounce it i'm substituting for michael gelb 'cause he couldn't come and this is where i was looking at scott's vitae and you know he's really involved with functional medicine so this is an area where i'd have been developing this lecture for them 
 and i adapted it for today's talk so instead of assessing pre-apnea in the pediatric dental patient you know and then what do with it clinically i'm just gonna talk about pediatric sleep apnea sort of as a western disease a non-communicable disease that is coe- seems to coexist with cultural industrialization 
 this is what i'm gonna tell you for 20 minutes 
 that jaws and faces are intimately connected to the airway and that orthotropics orthodontics dentofacial orthopedics it's the ortho that latin or greek for correct 
 john who is one who really turned me onto this about 20 years ago or 15 years ago 
 and actually got me access to the roman skulls at the british museum that he had access to and he developed and mike you can fill in the blanks on that of when he actually developed this in the fifties and sixties but i was there really to look at the same roman skulls 
 and have since looked at thousands of other skulls and and pretty much provided a lot of support for his orthotropic hypothesis 
 one of the things i found is that it works in kids while they still have their baby teeth 2 to six year-olds and i found literature from medical and dental literature from over a 100 years ago that seemed to validate this protocol that that we use in chicago and elsewhere 
 observational studies again as opposed to random controlled trials don't pooh-pooh at observational studies oh show me the random controlled trials bullshit 
 you know you need observational studies before you can run random controlled trials 
 how do you think they discovered you should wash your hands before you deliver babies 
 how do you think einstein you know came up the theory of relativity 
 these were all observations the broad street pump and cholera in england it was observations that led to major breakthroughs penicillin observational studies what drove these major breakthroughs in medicine and and humanity 
 here's a paper from 1912 the relief of nasal obstruction by orthodontia a plea for early recognition and correction of faulty maxillary development 
 do you know many papers i have like this that go back to the late 19 century 
 all the way up through about world war two something happened in world war two 
 and anthropologists have come up with really good speculations as to what happened which we can go into in q &amp; a if you want 
 the back of the face is the airway the front of the airway is the face 
 okay jaws and faces are intimately connected the craniofacial complex the respiratory system okay 
 and that's what we now call the craniofacial respiratory complex michael mew was the first to publish on craniofacial dystrophy 
 i have suggested that if there's craniofacial dystrophy there's often co-morbid respiratory dystrophy 
 so i would like you know and this we've got this in 3 textbooks now that have recently put chapters on what's called the craniofacial respiratory complex 
 this is from 1922 30 months of age being considered the most favorable time to begin expansion of children 
 i mean you are you are considered a heretic if you want to treat kids before the age of seven which is the american association of orthodontists says that is the age when children should shist- sh- first be observed observed for their first orthodontic evaluation 
 but usually not treated till between 11 and 13 
 that's what's common in the western world right now england and in america especially 
 i am really trying to persuade and be diplomatic 
 i've now got the editor-in-chief of the american journal of orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics engaged on a in a dialogue and that is not a not a debate it's a dialogue 
 and he is responding to what i'm saying that that age should be way before 7 
 7 years old is a geriatric patient in my pediatric practice 
 i've got kids coming from all over the country just like mike's got people coming to him from all over the world that are seeking this treatment because conventional thought just do not do that yet 
 this is a 2 year-old this is a john mew's design of a stage one bio-block appliance 
 i use this on kids you know if they got 20 teeth i'm gonna start expanding them 
 both parents have to be on board if one parent is negative i'm not gonna treat i refuse 
 both parents have to understand and at least be neutral to positive that this is in the best long term health interest of their kids and it is validated by a 100 years of observational studies 
 normal does not mean healthy 
 normal blood pressure 1 20 over 80 right 
 for whom a given population average amongst americans by the american heart association 
 how about these guys 
 look at the differences there 
 that's probably genomic that we all descend from this group this is the khoisan in in africa we we shared 99 point 9 percent if not more of their genome 
 everybody who got out of africa about 70000 years ago descended from this tribe 
 spencer wells and the genografic project watch that video it's incredible and he talks about this 
 what does normal mean in terms of occlusion 
 these are from orthodontic journals guess what this studied to determine what was normal 
 anthropological specimens a predated industry 
 okay this used to be part of dental education 
 the university of virginia's medical school in the twenties required third year third year medical students to take a course in orthodontics because of the commonly understood connection between respiratory health and occlusion 
 so all of these erupted third molars ahead of you know the condyles here 
 i don't know if this works 
 well you can see this is the ramus and the wisdom teeth are always ahead of it in lateral view 
 you don't even get wisdom teeth anymore 
 so i'm just gonna plaster these but the the orthodontic medical literature is loaded with specimens that inform clinicians during their training that come from pre-industrialized museum specimen 
 when this when this problem start 
 ontogeny the development of the individual from conception to death 
 phylogeny the that is the development of our species 
 when did malocclusion first enter our species and one when does it usually enter in from an ontological perspective perhaps in utero 
 these are fetal skulls from 4 5 100 years ago in of stillborn fetuses that didn't make it or or infants 
 they all look like john mew #* orthotropic #sounding 
 they all and if you look at an ultrasound of any of you who have children if you look at your mid-gestational ultrasounds 
 you'll very felt- seldom find a chin that sits right underneath the maxilla 
 so that's you know from an ontogeny perspective 
 and this is actually a kid i'm treating 
 the mother brought and she was i was treating for her one of her kids and she shows me an ultrasound and said it looks like i am making you another patient and it's like i wonder if there's a connection 
 all that was 7 years ago and we've since accumulated maybe 200 mid-gestational ultrasounds of kids that i'm treating for retrognathia 
 and there does seem to be a connection but it's seen that's observational it's not scientific yet so i'm not making any proclamations on any #* hundred 
 these are things that we so we understood the nature of respiration and failure to thrive or or intrauterine growth restriction 
 look at this and that what this says is people are always telling me that smoking causes low birth weight 
 talk about a win win win 
 you know easy labor slim baby full flavor of winston 
 so it this is a oh my god you should hear the interviews with these and these who work for the tobacco lobby 
 and it's like some women wanna have small babies 
 so anyway phylogeny is when it enters 
 now i imagine several hands will go up knowing the right answer to this but when i give this to physicians and dentists i very seldom get one hand coming up and it's usually not right 
 so this is something that needs to be incorporated into grade school how about it 
 so it looks like i got minutes 
 that so i'm really move through this 
 the the jaws and faces got narrower they got retrusive and they got longer 
 the last major milestone in the 7 million years of hominid evolution is the emergence of modern humans or homo sapiens 
 people who for the first time fundamentally looked and behaved like us 
 while a date of around 200000 years ago was frequently given for this dynamic there are still substantial debate regarding the timing as something that was an ongoing process rather than a single point in geological time 
 anatomically it is widely recognized that facial size reduction or gracilization or feminization as it is sometimes called 
 as well as facial retraction are key to finding traits for our species 
 so anyway i found literature a cause for lessened prognathism from the orthodontic literature from 1881 
 okay so this was understood as long ago as that that our faces but i think the retraction was just something that was academically interesting the people they didn't understand the connection or at least on a broad scale of its relationship to malocclusion and airway 
 so you know i'm saying that is you know breastfeeding has a lot to do with an ancestral patterns of nursing and weaning 
 but also papoosing look at that kid in the papoose the posture of that head and neck 
 so it wasn't just the nursing and weaning but it was also things like that 
 and also the the type of pressure that is exerted by click talking which is what a lot of african and the people that were related to do that's kind all kinds of pressure early in life 
 this is one of our ancestral museum skulls and you can look at the difference of that position 
 signs of mouth breathing the chin recedes mothers will accuse children of inattention they didn't call it add but this is from i don't know yeah 1908 look at this 
 so i'm gonna buzz these are just some cases 
 you could see that you know that the airway is retrusive it's black and narrow like that that means that kid has a very narrow and poorly shaped airway when you bring the chin forward you open up the airway 
 we don't just look at physical signs but behavioral 
 on the top those are all those yeses are behaviors that track with risk for sleep apnea and sleep apnea is a pre- predisposition to add 
 and they all come back no so now orthodontic criteria success criteria is not just physical changes but behavioral changes 
 i'm just you know how much time do i have 
 not much 
 okay three minutes 
 we've also discovered an algorithm from about 30 years of research at harvard and elsewhere where if you know a child should have space for a nickel between each baby tooth 
 that means there's room for the tongue 
 so when we see no space between baby teeth we know there is no room for the tongue 
 for no other reason not to straighten them they don't they don't even have to be crooked but we expand these kids and we give them tongue space 
 that is really the killer argument for this 
 and when you show parents and what happens when you make room for the tongue and what what happens to the airway is very it does no harm 
 it does no harm 
 it can help them solve it if they need more ortho down the road it's just like a kid who has nearsightedness 
 are you gonna tell a parent a 3 year-old whose kid is nearsighted you know what they'd be a good candidate for glasses someday why don't we give them when they're like driving a car then you have to pay for them once that's how ridiculous medically indefensible it is to say that you should delay orthodontics because a kid only as baby teeth 
 if anybody has children or first order second order relatives grand kids kids you may be the first person to recognize 
 ask the parent 
 watch and see if the kid is snoring 
 and you might be the person to to really help that kid avoid the problem 
 okay so i'm done i got more but got to end here so we can do some questions 
 @applause 
 @garbage-until-the-end 
 about mismatch and male but 
 there are other reasons 
 for why evolution as powerful cannot sculpt perfect 
 arms race race with pathogens especially scott presentation seemed affected for the mismatch effect of dense acellular carbohydrates is as tilted the playing field toward more virulent pathogenic bacterial species in 
 the mouth so how it mismatched intersects with another major category 
 was rushed for time before dimension other thing germs for gum disease have never changed always had we never had gum disease so 
 is it the germs or is the environment that 
 i 
 terms dense acellular carbohydrates just one there are lots of a 
 ted geisel we really 
 salivary is very important and not sleeping properly exhausted you're stressed so even if a nutrientdense diet you 
 so other words of the quality of your saliva 
 but it's not flowing you know you can heal demineralization also mouth breathing during poor sleep mouth breathing is dries the mouth 
 or intraarticular answers short so we can get more questions that that's a great question and it is a combination same thing with cavity 
 caries organisms they've been with us forever even use them to track migrations out of africa strep mutants is the primary cariogenic bacteria 
 paige caulfield at alabama actually bred alabama 
 trap he uses that to track migrations because those bacteria have been with us they've just never been pathogenic mean lack these deficiency isn't pathogenic you drink milk so it's the environment that change 
 into 
 this 
 press 
 there some magic or some key nutrient 
 to 
 that one thing 
 western price did darwin and i would say 
 that were some parts 
 so dark darwin got things wrong price einstein 
 k thing far stretched the chewing 
 you passed 
 absolutely so not diminish 
 steps right direction 
 that can't build a perfect 
 the nutrients you deserve so yes the nutrients are we just put the spotlight some we try to connect the dots and we're pretty 
 with vitamin i 
 western price 
 related constituents 
 data so with 
 groups one study was produced was 
 show you 
 make vitamin k deficient and they had stunted growth growth stunted maxilla 
 but it was stunted now 
 with confusing pathology with 
 vitamin deficiency is a pathological 
 i would say that the facial forms of everyone in the audience not grown correctly based on ancestral 
 so 
 you have 
 very rare significant 
 so yet really to find good evidence against to support 
 a question 
 other 
 avoid 
 oral rinses thanks 
 no nose breathing is key as young as early in life as pass that's my contribution like we have three dentists appear 
 thing i want to attack but that the only 
 you think scott well it starts with maternal and paternal nutrition years 
 scott start 
 once the child 
 you can see sometimes there 
 retro 
 jaws back so afterwards it's critical 
 what is going with facial for they have teeth 
 yes 
 paleo diet 
 not actually in the basis of recommending any specific but stay 
 our nutrients into your body you should be processed relating 
 probiotics 
 to me it's like if you're running 
 a nicer zoo tigers bears 
 but are rabbit pellets 
 bare feed 
 and if you have a zoo that's full of deer have so yes you can introduce bacteria probiotics that's all well but the environment that 
 is really what brings fish finding dentist i have a fish tank office 
 algae or whatever in there but it got in there and it's growing because it's a good environment for the bottle get 
 so that is and don't smoke 
 tobacco or 
 oral microbiome excessive brush mentioned out and 
 carry 
 already disrupted or altered xylitol getting of attention and the pediatric dentistry and i never been pro any one nutrient really down on sugar but there some impressive information 
 sila tall so stay tuned i agree 
 gum gum recession 
 gum recession like mike's mike's opinion because he's north adonis and commonly that is a problem so well holding lots teeth out 
 with retainers now you might on the teeth 
 cheeks 
 side that 
 if you need wear retainer you're holding teeth out of 
 whole gum tissue 
 i won't mention it's probably word few of you have heard it's called an abbe fraction so some of you may notice up 
 touch it's very sore notch there that's generally from the teeth colliding together if they're not aligned or grinder 
 real heavy gum chewer forces connection 
 by the gum line recession still yet another reason to get your children's jaws their tongue early in life 
 prevents adult problems start so don't if your instincts says my kid needs their jaw expanded the orthodontist as 
 well this or 
 gum disease orthodontics subsequent 
 so we have to current 
 fake
