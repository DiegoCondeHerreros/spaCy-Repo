my next patient is mai 
 and she is a female about 14 years old 
 and she's got a very constricted arch and a tooth size discrepancy 
 we're talking at this time in this session about the bolton analysis i'm gonna cover that in this presentation 
 but right now we're gonna talk about this 14 year-old girl now remember most girls will grow to 14 or 15 
 so she still could have some growth potential left 
 but you can see with her smile is very narrow here 
 got a very narrow constricted arch very narrow smile and we wanna fix that 
 she's also got two lingually displaced lateral incisors 
 and she's got two deciduous lateral incisors in position but the permanent lateral incisors are lingually displaced 
 and we've talked about this many times but the reason that the lateral incisors come in lingually displaced is 'cause you've got a narrow constricted upper arch 
 so that all could have been avoided if she'd had a an an expansion appliance when she was 6 7 8 9 10 11 whenever 
 or she wore it actually earlier before the laterals erupted so so the earlier the better probably the expansion appliance should have come in at 6 or 7 
 and then they would have been room for the lateral incisors and then hopefully they wouldn't have erupted in the lingual 
 so again that's why the the treatment of children at an early age diagnosis and treatment is so important 
 her profile looks very straight 
 in fact it looks almost prognathic it looks like she could be a slight class 3 she's either a class 3 or a class 1 and again i don't have the ceph in the presentation 
 but i have the ceph and all the records for all the cases but i just haven't shown you all the cephs and all the records for all the cases but for sure she looks like she could be a slight class 3 or or a class 1 
 let's look at the at the occlusion 
 well if you look carefully you can see she's almost end-to-end 
 and over in this photo on the left it looks like the lower incisors are lingually torqued 
 so when you see the lower incisor lingually torqued you've got to be suspicious of a class 3 
 plus the cuspid is slightly class 3 plus the molar is definitely class 3 
 so you've got a class 3 molar class 3 cuspid lower incisors lingually inclined that's a class 3 
 and you hope now that she's all through growing 
 but remember she's 14 she could grow to 15 and sometimes class 3 s even grow longer 
 so we have to be aware of that we have to worry that that the mandible might come forward on us and then that's definitely a concern 
 the other thing that we look at is we can see remember i told you there's the lateral incisor that's lingually displaced there's th- the deciduous lateral there's the two bicuspids in crossbite and if you look here at the frontal photo you can see that both sides look like they're going in 
 it looks like a very constricted upper arch 
 we like to see a nice broad arch we don't like to see a constricted arch again this case should have been treated earlier 
 so we look at we look at that situation and and the other thing you have to remember is when you expand an arch you sometimes open the bite 
 now she's end-to-end here she's got like a 1 millimeter overjet and 1 millimeter overbite 
 so when you expand an arch you have to worry about the bite opening in the front 
 when you expand an arch on a class 3 and you free up the mandible and the patient still has some growth potential left then the mandible could come forward so she could come forward into a class three so this looks like a relatively easy case but you have to be aware that this could this could be a more difficult case 
 if the bite opens and if if the mandible comes forward then it's not an easy case so so class 3 potential cases are not easy cases 
 and you can see she has some other interesting things happening here 
 again you can see the lateral incisors on the palate you can see the deciduous laterals in place and you can see a very constricted archs particularly area of the bicuspids 
 and you can also see that that the l- the the upper first bicuspids are much larger than the upper second bicuspids there's quite a tooth size discrepancy here 
 so look at the size of the upper first bicuspid and then the upper second bicuspid and look at the lower bicuspids the lower bicuspids both look normal size 
 so again you'd have to worry that if you had a tooth size discrepancy are you going to get a proper occlusion at the end 
 are the are the occlusion in the area of the bicuspids and the cuspids gonna be normal when you've got such a large upper first bicuspid such a small second bicuspid and then and normal size lower bicuspids 
 i think you should mention that to the patient that you know y- you have some different shaped teeth that might make it difficult to get a final perfect finish 
 we're still gonna have your teeth straight you still gonna have a nice smile 
 but maybe that the the bite won't be absolutely perfect but it'll still it'll still be able to chew to your food you'll still be fine but we may not be able to get a textbook finish because we don't have a proper sized teeth to start with 
 but don't worry we'll do the best we can 
 so with that now the lower arch always in class 3 you've got a broad arch and you can see that's a nice broad arch the other interesting thing is look at how these teeth are rolled lingually 
 look at how the second bicuspid and the molars are torqued lingually like this 
 so you know that when we put our straight wire brackets on 
 remember the torque on our on our bic- bicuspids and molars are minus 12 
 so the torque on our molars minus 12 so we put we put our arch wire into the slot the tooth is gonna go to minus 12 
 well if the tooth starts out in minus 35 like this 
 tooth starts out at minus 35 and you can see those teeth are really lingually inclined and then you put an arch wire in there you're gonna upright that tooth to minus 12 
 so we're gonna get a lot of uprighting on the lower arch with our brackets 
 pre-program brackets to upright to minus 12 
 so we're definitely gonna have to expand and upright those already in crossbite but when the lowers upright we're gonna have to expand the upper or they'll all gonna be in buccal crossbite 
 so you have to consider that and look carefully to arches 
 and both sides you can see the molars and the bicuspids are definitely lingually inclined and the incisor look very upright 
 or maybe slightly lingually inclined 
 so that's very common in class 3 s 
 so that's the case 
 again very large upper first bicuspid is very small second bicuspid tooth size discrepancy 
 you need to do the bolton analysis on your cases prior to treatment to say if you do have a tooth size discrepancy 
 if you do you need to mention that to the patients ahead of time so their expectations for a sore so-called perfect finish are not there 
 so my treatment plan was to use a banded hyrax on the upper i i like the banded hyrax it's one of my favorite appliances 
 you can make it with a memory screw where you turn the screw or you can make with a regular her where the patient turns the screw twice a week 
 and it consists of a band on the first molars and mesial rests on the first bicuspids and and a hyrax screw it's a very simple appliance and it's a very effective appliance 
 so there we have it we have the the midline screw 
 and you can see the arrows 
 and we have keys now that have a light 
 and those keys with a light on in are excellent 
 and you need to talk to the labs and because the parents when they're trying to adjust that or or she's trying to adjust it she can't see back there 
 so we have a light 
 you can even shine the light on you can see with that 
 i i'm pointing right now to the to the opening and the screw and you put your key in that 
 and and the arrows are going back and they'll turn it back all the way 
 you see put the key in the anterior part and turn it back and then take it out 
 and the key is on a swivel 
 so get the key with a with a light 
 they're not that expensive and the lab will include that with a appliance 
 and that'll make it easier for the patient to adjust that appliance and they'll need to adjust it twice a week 
 i tell them every wednesday every saturday every wednesday every saturday then they'll remember 
 so with the cemented bands i never gonna put flowable composite on the mesial rests 
 and remember i've told this before i like to fit my own bands 
 so bring the patient in one week before 
 i put the separators mesial and distal to the first molars on both sides 
 bring the patient back in a week take the separators out fit the 2 bands 
 take the band's off the teeth put them on a cotton roll slide the bands on a cotton roll wrap them up carefully so they won't get distorted 
 take an upper impression of the of the molars separated 
 poured in yellow stone and send the upper model and the two bands to the lab and they'll send you back the hyrax and you know it's gonna fit 
 because you fit the bands 
 if you ask the lab to fit the bands and they scrape the model sometimes the hyrax won't fit the bands won't fit th- with the patient and that's not good 
 so we recommend that's you fit the bands plus you're gonna have your tubes on the buccal 
 so as soon as we expand we get to #* into straight wire and we've got our brackets on the on the teeth 
 we want our brackets on the on the teeth with the with the proper tip and torque 
 so there it is but don't forget to some to to bond with flowable composite the mesial rests 
 otherwise you've just got 2 teeth holding while you want retention of 4 teeth 
 the reason you have the rest is because this bar right here if you don't put the rest on the mesial besides giving it better retention that bar could dig in right here on the palate and cause discomfort for the patient 
 so always use mesial rests 
 so here's the base and now we've expanded the hyrax 4 millimeters 
 we i usually like to do the expansion first before i put the straight wire on it 
 'cause i find when there is more room in the arch then they the brackets come on better and the teeth aren't so sore when room for the teeth they don't hurt nearly as much when you straight them 
 so we've expanded 4 millimeters but i wanted to see what's happening with our expansion remember i told you when you expand a case you have to think sometimes the bite will open 
 well you can see our our patient now has got a but a [half a millimeter] open bite here on the right side 
 and you can see that the cuspid now has gone into class 3 and the molar is class 3 
 so what's happening is the bite is opening and the mandible is slowly coming forward a little more class 3 so that makes the case a lot more difficult 
 so we're losing our class 1 cuspid we're losing our class 1 molar relationship on this side and we're opening the bite a little bit on the front and we're just getting started 
 we've only opened the hyrax screw 4 millimeters and we need more expansion 
 now we've opened 6 millimeters 
 but look what's happening on the on the left side 
 we started out with a slight class 3 cuspid relationship and now it's about 2 or 3 millimeters class 3 
 and the molar is worse now is much more class 3 than when we started 
 so for sure the mandible because you expand the maxilla the mandible is coming forward a little bit 
 possibly the mandible is trapped and the condyle wants to move a little bit down and forward to a more comfortable position 
 and one key would be if you did a tmj evaluation of the patient and found some signs and symptoms of tmj you would you need to expect it to happen 
 so patients with temporomandibular joint dysfunction and you expand the upper arch the mandible will definitely come down and forward trying to get the condyle a more comfortable position in the glenoid fossa away from the nerves and blood vessels 
 the patient almost decompresses their own joint if you allow the mandible to have room to move to a different position 
 so you can see this case now is is is shaping up to be a much more difficult case than we started to thought in the beginning 
 because we've got a class 3 cuspid class 3 molar 
 now we're almost end-to-end in fact almost into an anterior crossbite here we're in there so any more movement we could go into crossbite 
 the we extracted 1 the primary lateral on the on the on the left side 
 and you can see the permanent laterals there 
 and we've expanded about 6 millimeters now so maybe we're almost into position you can see here on the on the on the right side sorry on the left side we've extracted that primary lateral now we're gonna straight- straighten that one lateral incisor 
 a lot my patients like the clear brackets 
 well i have 2 typodonts actually i've 3 typodonts i've got one typodont with the diamond brackets and the colored ligature ties which i show the children 
 i've got another typodont with the clear brackets 
 and the clear brackets that i have now are called the neolucent clear brackets 
 i get those from ortho organizers in the united states and i get them from cerum ortho in canada and they're excellent they're translucent brackets and they are really nice because you the the the true color of the tooth comes right to #* and you can hardly see the brackets 
 this was a technique that we tried for a while when we put these crosses on here 
 but the trouble with those crosses was they only came in one color and and if you have different color teeth sometimes they look good sometimes they didn't 
 what we're trying to do is get away from the ligature ties that stain that's the big disadvantage of the clear brackets is the ligature tie stain 
 we've got smoky and pearl 
 two ligature ties by ortho organizers that don't stain as much okay so it's called pearl and smokey so those the ones we use now 
 we've used these crosses for a while but we don't use those anymore we've found that they weren't they weren't very effective 
 so you can see but this case had the crosses and we just put we put the brackets on cuspid to cuspid 
 the the clear brackets are more bulky than the metal brackets but they look a lot better and lot of patients want them 
 but if you can get away with just going from cuspid to cuspid with the clear brackets try that because then the metal brackets are are less bulky on the bicuspids and and a little easier on the patient's cheek 
 they don't they don't protrude as much 
 so we've just tied that in now with an o 1 4 [.014] ni ti wire that's our number 1 leveling wire we start most of our cases with that 
 so with 60 grams of force we can bend it 87 degrees you won't distort it it's an excellent wire very light gentle continuous forces 
 its nickel titanium 
 we call it ni ti 
 and and now we've tied everything in so it goes right back to the molar remember the molars got a hyrax 
 now it looks like we've overexpanded the upper 
 but remember the lower teeth haven't haven't been bracketed yet and they're gonna upright with the torque that's built into my brackets the minus 12 torque 
 it's built in the cuspids sorry the bicuspid the molars so those teeth and upright on their own with just the wires 
 so we have to overexpand anticipating that 
 so you can see we've tied everything in 
 here it is now this is the occlusal view you've open 6 millimeters the hyrax has opened 6 millimeters 
 and you can see that the o 1 4 [.014] nickel titanium #* is tied in 
 and you can see that for sure the the clear brackets are definitely bulkier than the metal brackets 
 there is the metal bracket in the bicuspid there's the clear bracket on the on the lateral but patients don't care usually they they don't care they want the appearance 
 they don't want the brackets that show 
 and and and i think clear brackets are vastly underrated 
 i mean most patients don't even know about clear brackets 
 so you really should have some brochures in your office in your waiting room showing pages about clear brackets so they know by the clear brackets 
 everybody knows about invisalign 
 everybody knows about metal brackets 
 they don't know about clear brackets 
 and there is a lot of patients in my practice that wouldn't have braces unless i offer them the clear 
 so i always show them the clear brackets and and a lot of them want that 
 if they want faster treatment of course we go to self-ligating brackets 
 if they want they want the fastest treatment they go self-ligating with no colored ligature ties if they want a little slower treatment but they want nice aesthetic result then they go with the clear 
 so again we haven't ti- we haven't activated the there's no room for this lateral on the lingual on the on the right 
 but over here you can see there is room for the for the lateral on the left 
 so if there's the room for the lateral on the left we tie in the left lateral but the right lateral we're gonna leave for a while and then we have to put an open coil in there to make space for that too 
 @void 
 so again this tooth is lingually displaced here 
 and you can see now it's tied in and it's it's it's looking good 
 okay so it probably took about 2 months we have to tie in that tooth 3 at the most to get that tooth into position 
 now the hyrax is open 10 millimeters 
 lots of expansion 'cause remember those lowers we wanna upright we want a nice broad smile 
 and now we've got an open coil over here to make room for the right lateral incisor so left lateral incisor is in line now we're gonna put an open coil in here to try to make room for the right lateral incisor we don't wanna tied it in until there's room 
 so there we have it 
 the patient now has to be in a working wire remember we lined up the left lateral with a with a leveling wire the o 1 4 ni ti 
 now that the tooth is lined up and you can see it there's the tooth nicely lined up the left lateral is in position 
 now what we wanna do we want to make room for the right lateral 
 so i put a piece of open coil on 
 remember we measure from the mesial of the cuspid the bracket on the cuspid to the distal of the bracket on the on the central and say that's say that's 10 millimeters 
 so you got 10 plus 4 it's 14 millimeters 
 you cut a piece of open coil of 14 millimeter slide it on the arch wire and then compress it 
 tie it in and then it tries to do that with a compressed coil of 14 the space is only 10 as soon as you take off the as soon as you tie in the brackets it wants to do this and so that will slowly make space 
 don't use more than 4 or you might cause rotation of the teeth in the end 
 and you're trying to prevent rotation not cause rotations 
 so we're just gonna change that every month the patient comes in you measure the space at 4 millimeters cut new piece of open coil and put in there it might take 3 months to make the space 
 and we must be in a working wire 
 it's got 2 working wires 
 you've got the o 1 8 [.018] cna which is 280 grams or you've got the 19 25 [19x25] v 4 3 [v4 3] which is a hundred 2 hundred and 3 hundred grams 
 v 4 means variable force 3 force levels into one wire 
 but now we've got the o 1 8 ni t- o 1 8 cna in the upper and in the bottom we're just starting to line the teeth up so we've got the o 1 8 ni ti at the bottom 
 now if the if the teeth are pretty straight which the lower ones were we can start with an o 1 8 ni ti 
 if the teeth were crooked or if the patient was really very sensitive teeth i would start with an o 1 4 [.014] ni ti but when the teeth are pretty straight we start with an o 1 8 ni ti #* about 80 grams of force which is which is very light gentle forces 
 the other thing you have to worry about is when you put the brackets on a class 3 case and there's and there's any crowding in the lower the lower incisors will flare 
 and you'll cause more of an anterior crossbite which you don't want 
 so you can see my bite is opening my bite is opening more 
 i've got a 1 millimeter anterior open bite over here 
 i've got my cuspid still class 3 
 i've got my molar class 3 
 i've got my separators in down here to put a molar band on that lower molar 
 but my case is getting more difficult isn't it 
 i mean we're we are developing an anterior open bite 
 where where where the mandible is coming forward i've got a class 3 cuspid class 3 molar 
 this is a more difficult case to treat
