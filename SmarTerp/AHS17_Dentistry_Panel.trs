@applause
<Sync time="10.000"/>
 thank you generous introduction 
<Sync time="12.710"/>
 this is showing normal (blood pressure) for whom Americans and as you can see with age and with the the differences between genders and so you can see female male but anyway this is something that we consider normal 
<Sync time="40.410"/>
 so I have sort of a new definition for what a wellness continuum is it's usually predicated on diet nutrition and exercise and physical activity 
<Sync time="53.250"/>
 we now propose a triangle with (sleep and airway hygiene) and I was so glad to hear the talk this morning about ancestral sleep something and very much interested in helping develop 
<Sync time="67.451"/>
 sorry to interrupt but you don't need the you don't need to hold #* 
<Sync time="69.608"/>
 I don't need this yeah I've got I just like holding a microphone
<Sync time="75.480"/>
 so in stress level figures into this continuum somewhere and I I don't quite know where I think it modulates all of them
<Sync time="85.155"/>
 (diet nutrition) is by directional I mean (comfort food) right we can alleviate stress with it and we can cause stress and inflammation by (over-nutrition) wrong nutrition non (paleo-nutrition)
<Sync time="97.576"/>
 same thing with exercise some people do it to relax but it also can if it's not done correctly you can put stresses in the system 
<Sync time="105.030"/>
 sleep and (airway) hygiene hygiene does not mean clean hygiene means health okay so (dental hygiene) clean teeth that's one component of hygiene 
<Sync time="115.950"/>
 hygiene sleep and airway hygiene is something that we are now teaching (dental hygienists) to in addition to cleaning teeth we want you to assess (airway health)
<Sync time="125.260"/>
 so anyway normal does not equal healthy alright normal means average 
<Sync time="132.305"/>
 and and I'm preaching to the choir obviously you know this but this is gonna be on the Internet and are hoping our dental and medical colleagues will be learning from this as well so some of the stuff I don't want you think oh he doesn't know we don't know that we know that 
<Sync time="149.235"/>
 well anyway how about this how about an ancestral norm
<Sync time="154.977"/>
 now I'm I'm just using (blood pressure) but it depends on the environment that you're subjected to that determines what is normal and normal equal healthy well 1 20 over 80 probably is is healthy but it probably should be or genomically we have the potential to have lower blood pressure 
<Sync time="176.580"/>
 but we're an industrialized society so that's that's as good as it's gonna get for now but maybe when we have our impact on society which we will and we are maybe these 10 years know they might revise these
<Sync time="192.504"/>
 well the same thing exists in (orthodontics) okay
<Sync time="196.126"/>
 the norms that have been established from the nineteen fifties by two white guys who took a couple of kids that they thought were good looking and they were powerful 
<Sync time="204.345"/>
 and these are the norms they're mainly by a guy named Steiner and Downs and these are really the foundation of the norms are used by most orthodontists look at your kids and they're their (misdiagnosing)
<Sync time="217.986"/>
 I'm not indicting the orthodontic profession in fact you will hear later from Scott that Western dentistry is a wonderful thing it does the best that it can 
<Sync time="228.765"/>
 we want to push it in a direction that can help with be #* all that #* can be by having it be more ancestrally focused well orthodontic norms are leading to kids being treated too late and be treated inappropriately
<Sync time="242.829"/>
 if orthodontics was only about cosmetics this really wouldn't be that big a deal I got beautifully (straight teeth) but I had teeth pulled out with a (headgear) and need (jaw surgery) 
<Sync time="252.420"/>
 I'm not (overweight) and I (snore) like a train so it's you know and that can be damaging to end in organ damage 
<Sync time="259.905"/>
 so what we're saying is what is a new norm that we can use for our little kids
<Sync time="265.715"/>
 that's a 500 year-old (palate) of one of our museum (specimens) okay and what I want you to pay attention to is this this is the back nose the (posterior naris) this is your (nasal septum) coming all the way from the front this is where air enters into your throat the (pharynx) okay it correlates with the with and the depth and the length of the palate
<Sync time="288.817"/>
 okay and that's that's you know anyone who wants a reference on anything I'm not putting them up here but I have references on everything I say you can google anything I say I am not lying about or exaggerating about anything it's all scientifically medically defensible 
<Sync time="304.650"/>
 so anyway we're proposing a new norm for orthodontics okay
<Sync time="311.295"/>
 and this is pretty much something that we we go back and a lot of this was covered in other lectures today
<Sync time="319.877"/>
 but you know about 2 and a half million years ago that's (genus) Homo when it when it came into being 
<Sync time="327.660"/>
 40000 years that's Europeans Cromagnons and then we say 10000 it's probably 15000 when agriculture and domestication of plants started in different places but we use that 10 to 12 thousand thing but it's changing all the time
<Sync time="345.683"/>
 but that's when we start to see appreciable increases in (tooth decay) 
<Sync time="349.770"/>
 now when I first heard this I thought it was a lie because I would have learned about it in dental school huh right this is like Paul Simon when I think back and all the crap I learned in high school 
<Sync time="361.185"/>
 well #* some other things I didn't learn in dental school was this because I didn't have to take any anthropology or revolutionary biology is basic science again into school none of us did the physicians don't nobody in healthcare does 
<Sync time="374.805"/>
 it's not required it should be if it is like according to Randy Nessie it's as if an engineer could be call themselves an engineer without having to take a course in physics 
<Sync time="385.185"/>
 that's how bad it is
<Sync time="386.678"/>
 anyway this is my academy of (pediatric dentistry) and you can see this is our policy statements and practice guidelines everything and they have this little thing here it's it all has to do with (early gum disease) early childhood (tooth decay) early gum disease and tooth decay (tartar) and that's something that Al is going to talk about later we think of (plaque) as being intrinsically bad 
<Sync time="416.820"/>
 he is gonna talk about good plaque okay
<Sync time="419.359"/>
 we find 15000 year-old plaque fossilized it's called (calculus)
<Sync time="423.346"/>
 and there's no gum disease or bone loss or anything associated with it so I really looking forward to what he has to say 
<Sync time="431.640"/>
 nothing about (malocclusion)
<Sync time="433.727"/>
 okay are we we do in our statement now we have a practice guideline for (sleep apnea) 
<Sync time="439.665"/>
 which is good and we have all kinds of things about orthodontics but really nothing connecting the 2 and that's what I am trying to do with my research and by talking to groups like you 
<Sync time="451.545"/>
 if we can end (childhood obesity) why is it that we can't end (tooth decay)
<Sync time="457.277"/>
 okay and you you really just don't hear it
<Sync time="461.573"/>
 well because childhood obesity is a (nutritionally modulated condition) it can be prevented 
<Sync time="466.425"/>
 Michelle Obama she said we can end it in a generation she she's I think she's technically right it's practically not too realistic but it could be done hypothetically well so too can tooth decay because it involves (bacteria) but it is a (diet modulated disease) so we could end it because at one time we used to not really appreciably have it
<Sync time="490.984"/>
there's always been tooth decay
<Sync time="492.676"/>
 so it didn't start with agriculture that you can go thou- hundreds of thousands of years and find tooth decay but it wasn't appreciable
<Sync time="499.773"/>
 there wasn't much 
<Sync time="501.375"/>
 okay honey can cause tooth decay and we know our ancestors ate honey
<Sync time="505.259"/>
 but what would dentists do when there is no tooth decay
<Sync time="508.215"/>
 I have a very busy practice in Chicago and less than 10 percent of what I do generating income providing services has anything to do tooth decay
<Sync time="521.961"/>
 I'm sort of known as a sugar scoundrel
<Sync time="525.474"/>
 I I tell parents politely look if your if your kid if you're not gonna you know eat the stuff out of the house this might not be the (practice) for you 
<Sync time="536.377"/>
 I don't think I've lost patients before but not for that most parents love it that that I they were strict such as me and my partner and my my team my staff
<Sync time="547.035"/>
 so (nutrition counseling) again the next 2 speakers are gonna talk a little bit about that they're very proactive with it I have a dietetics a nutrition dietetics degree and I don't do near the degree of counseling that these guys do and #* got some amazing forms
<Sync time="564.871"/>
 this is people have been exploring this this was in the Journal of Science in 2012 it was a focus group an extant focus group at Duke University
<Sync time="575.255"/>
 and I was on a panel with 8 anthropologists and 8 dentists and we came up with this and there's been some articles that look at malocclusion from an evolutionary perspective
<Sync time="587.018"/>
 so other people are curious about this 
<Sync time="589.545"/>
 one of the things that happens
<Sync time="591.45"/>
 I don't know why it's the whole space or some- I don't know if that an AV guy can do it
<Sync time="596.130"/>
 because everything is squed over
<Sync time="598.731"/>
 well anyway what happens is 200 thousand 250 thous- 300 thousand years as (hunter-gatherers) right
<Sync time="607.811"/>
 our (jaws) were wider more forward and more less vertical
<Sync time="613.657"/>
 okay what happened with agriculture and industry is that the jaws have got narrower more (retrusive) and vertical they've fallen down
<Sync time="621.639"/>
 this is a U- the Universal (phenotypes) of a modernization
<Sync time="626.054"/>
 if you take an extant hunter-gatherer 
<Sync time="628.305"/>
 and move them to the big City in one generation you will see (crowding) that can't be genetic this is an (epigenetic) phenomenon
<Sync time="636.087"/>
 so this is what happens
<Sync time="637.81"/>
 now it has implications for (apnea) the (airway) and does everyone know that (ADD) (ADHD) when you clear up the sleep and improve the breathing usually the symptoms go away from (ADD) (ADHD) and you can many kids we've taken off (Ritalin) just by improving their sleep by changing the shape of the (jaw) some as young as 2 years old
<Sync time="660.788"/>
 okay I'm doing orthodontics on 2 year olds
<Sync time="663.475"/>
 and the most of them referred from (pulmonary specialist) (ENTs) (pediatricians) let's let's let Boyd try nothing else has worked
<Sync time="671.601"/>
 we took the (tonsils) out and the (adenoids) grew back and the kid's apnea is bad or worse alright
<Sync time="676.710"/>
 this is something that is taught in orthodontic programs and orthodontic textbooks that a (retrognatic chin) is a normal trait and you can see it (in utero) 
<Sync time="688.275"/>
 okay and here it is in the textbook but that's just not true
<Sync time="693.247"/>
 it's not true there's not a shred of evidence for it
<Sync time="695.915"/>
 and what we have found in our (samples) at the Penn museum is that (skulls) (fetal) (cadaver skulls) before the Industrial Revolution are all (bimaxillary) (protrusive) okay
<Sync time="709.035"/>
 that implies that they come into the world with the potential the (morphology) for a (healthy airway) 
<Sync time="715.755"/>
 okay the front of the airway is the face the back of the face is the airway we don't say (craniofacial) anymore we say (cranial respiratory)
<Sync time="724.395"/>
 what happens in the face the (palatal-facial sutural complex) you have (fontanelle) (soft spots) all over the place in your cranial respiratory complex
<Sync time="734.725"/>
 so this is the difference and we just superimposed a couple it's not terribly scientific but 
<Sync time="740.130"/>
 and this width I told you correlates with the ability to get air through the (paranasal sinus complex) into the (pharynx) which to the (lungs) to the (brain) 
<Sync time="752.550"/>
 so there you go you've got a narrow jaw you got a narrow posterior (naris)
<Sync time="757.971"/>
 a wider jaw wider airway less resistance 
<Sync time="762.180"/>
 treatment of apnea and yes little kids get apnea lots of them 
<Sync time="768.079"/>
and little kids right now the treatment of choice is (tonsil) and (adenoid) removal 
<Sync time="777.224"/>
 or they cut a hole in your throat and I've got mainly syndromic kids that come in with (tracheotomies) okay
<Sync time="783.844"/>
 or (maxillomandibular advancement) look at that what in medicine do you know has a greater than 90 percent success rate 
<Sync time="792.540"/>
 every patient by virtue of the the the name a procedure that will fix it maxillo- maxilla mandibular advancement that means pre-surgically they are maxillomandibular retrusive
<Sync time="804.387"/>
 and it starts probably in utero certainly while they're in their (baby teeth)
<Sync time="810.662"/>
 okay this is one of my patients this is her when she was like 5 and here she was 2 and a half months ago in (intensive care) for 3 days okay
<Sync time="823.346"/>
 her dad is a dentist and did not know how to do for her when she was this age 
<Sync time="831.720"/>
 so that's what had to be done
<Sync time="833.986"/>
 he did know what to do for her the little sister 
<Sync time="837.630"/>
 and she did need jaw surgery and they now look like well their their their airways look remark- #*
<Sync time="843.480"/>
 this is her where the adenoids are it's very narrow should be really wide and it's not so she got her tonsils out look how wide it is but look how narrow it is here 
<Sync time="854.025"/>
 and on 3 dimensional cone beam you can see it's is really nice up here but it should be all the way down like this okay
<Sync time="863.484"/>
 there she is now after her surgery
<Sync time="865.397"/>
 cured (TMJ) (anxiety) (depression) (apnea)
<Sync time="872.13"/>
 just really she was tired all the time
<Sync time="874.918"/>
 she had a (degenerative) (jaw joint) (TMJ) and it's all fixed okay 
<Sync time="881.550"/>
 there she is today 
<Sync time="883.830"/>
 okay now I know this kid really well that's my daughter 
<Sync time="887.625"/>
 and you when we drove to Saint Louis to get the (surgery) you were thought she was going to get a manicure she was so excited she didn't care about the intensive care and being on the table for 10 hours
<Sync time="899.297"/>
 here's another patient that my partner Janet Pannaralla does all the adults
<Sync time="903.34"/>
 so she and I don't treat my own kids so she did all the (orthognatic set-up) for this
<Sync time="907.789"/>
 but we have people flying in from all over the country to get this done
<Sync time="913.189"/>
 I don't we also you know this is a last resort this is a rescue 
<Sync time="918.300"/>
 but look at that you know
<Sync time="920.455"/>
 that's what happens
<Sync time="923.639"/>
 okay now hypothetically if I would have known her when she was 3 maybe I could have prevented this maybe I could have prevented my own daughter having to have gone through that
<Sync time="932.075"/>
 okay so there's (nonsurgical options) okay
<Sync time="936.364"/>
 one is weight loss
<Sync time="938.577"/>
 okay (C-pap) look at that little babies on C-pap
<Sync time="942.103"/>
right you think of it for an old person's disease
<Sync time="944.632"/>
 one way (nasal valves) 
<Sync time="947.130"/>
 (mandibular advancement devices)
<Sync time="949.409"/>
 okay this one and they just bring the jaw forward so you can breathe better right
<Sync time="954.115"/>
 this is what I do okay this is called (orthotropics) 
<Sync time="957.600"/>
 and this is what happens
<Sync time="960.211"/>
 I can create a maxil- maxillary and mandibular advancement I like to get them under the age of 6 we call it kids with (LTS) it sounds like a syndrome right with less than 6 
<Sync time="970.935"/>
 number of permanent teeth number of years of age that's when I ideally like to get them
<Sync time="975.943"/>
 I can fix a 10 year-old it's a lot harder 12 it's almost impossible to create this
<Sync time="981.773"/>
 so anyway that's what it looks like
<Sync time="985.355"/>
 again kids as young as 2 years old we're fixing 
<Sync time="989.325"/>
 they're very tiny little (retainers) that go in I do different kinds now that are basically most of them are glued in
<Sync time="996.81"/>
but you can see what happens
<Sync time="998.596"/>
 this kid didn't even get the tonsils out and this is an orthodontist Florida who discovered this independently and we've gotten to be friends now
<Sync time="1006.649"/>
 but it's amazing how good it looks and how well and healthy these kids are 
<Sync time="1013.670"/>
 this is a kid who had her tonsils out twice or her adenoids out twice and then we did this and that's how we fixed her
<Sync time="1021.290"/>
 this is how it works real quickly 
<Sync time="1024.839"/>
@void
<Sync time="1028.127"/>
 #* it pulls it forward
<Sync time="1032.132"/>
 we do it (non surgically) but that's how it works (surgically) too 
<Sync time="1036.335"/>
 the (Hippocratic oath) do no retraction most orthodontics or lack of orthodontics will keep a (retrusive face) back or make it even worse okay we say treat early and treat protrusively
<Sync time="1051.113"/>
@void 
<Sync time="1055.330"/>
 oh there we go I'm done so our next panelist will be up there thank you
<Sync time="1060.189"/>
@applause
<Sync time="1064.394"/>
good job thanks thanks sorry to #* 
<Sync time="1068.033"/>
 thanks Kevin
<Sync time="1068.83"/>
 next I'd like to introduce Alvin Alvin Danenberg
<Sync time="1073.928"/>
 Alvin has been a periodontist for 43 years 
<Sync time="1078.380"/>
 and he faced some serious personal health challenges in middle age where he was able to address using an (ancestral diet) and lifestyle
<Sync time="1086.837"/>
 and that was part of his inspiration for incorporating ancestral nutrition and lifestyle advice into his practice #*
<Sync time="1093.840"/>
 I also wanted to mention that he just released a book called Crazy Good Living and he'll be doing a meet and greet for that book right after this panel if you're interested in that 
<Sync time="1104.615"/>
 so Alvin take it away
<Sync time="1106.949"/>
 super so I'm gonna be a little more practical 
<Sync time="1113.000"/>
 I'm gonna talk about (dental plaque) and Kevin started the subject matter and that is dental plaque is healthy until it's unhealthy
<Sync time="1127.117"/>
 so most people think that they need to remove dental plaque as a matter of fact if you go your dentist and your (hygienist) they're going to make every effort to remove dental plaque and show you how to remove all the dental plaque 
<Sync time="1142.400"/>
 give you (antimicrobial) (mouthwashes) to kill every (bacteria) and (microbe) in your mouth and that's theoretically healthy
<Sync time="1151.384"/>
 but it's not
<Sync time="1152.949"/>
 so dental plaque has a purpose
<Sync time="1155.263"/>
 it is a (biological film) (biofilm)
<Sync time="1159.088"/>
 it is made up of hundreds of microbes
<Sync time="1162.351"/>
 some are good some are bad
<Sync time="1164.806"/>
 but they are the state of (homeostasis) or balance 
<Sync time="1168.380"/>
 and what that means is they serve a purpose
<Sync time="1171.969"/>
 if you took out any of the good bacteria in dental plaque the (pathogenic) bacteria would overgrow
<Sync time="1179.468"/>
 if you took out the pathogenic bacteria in dental plaque the good bacteria could change into pathogenic bacteria or allow other pathogenic bacteria that wouldn't even be involved to come in
<Sync time="1193.200"/>
 so dental plaque that is healthy dental plaque actually maintains a balanced (pH) under the (gum tissue) and around the tooth which is more neutral rather than acid
<Sync time="1203.72"/>
 it helps to kill off other pathogenic bacteria that wants to come into the area because it makes its own (hydrogen peroxide)
<Sync time="1212.458"/>
 and in addition it helps (remineralize) the teeth
<Sync time="1216.008"/>
 so your tooth actually is going through a state of remineralisation 24 7 because of the nutrients in the saliva that eventually get into the dental plaque and eventually do what they need to do on the surface of the tooth
<Sync time="1230.846"/>
 so if you remove dental plaque you don't have this protection and this is what dental plaque is designed to do to
<Sync time="1236.947"/>
so there are some products on the market that are effective in removing dental plaque all the time
<Sync time="1245.231"/>
so if you use that (xylitol) in your mouth at #* that you need to do this all the time you will not allow the (pellicle) which is the earliest form of dental plaque to form on the root of the tooth 
<Sync time="1259.685"/>
 and you would not have the benefit of healthy dental plaque so what we're gonna happen when healthy dental plaque becomes unhealthy dental plaque
<Sync time="1268.689"/>
 now I give you an example
<Sync time="1271.146"/>
 there are two studies phenomenal studies 2009 a guy named Baumgartner and his research people looked at 10 individuals in Switzerland
<Sync time="1282.821"/>
 so they were living in Switzerland in a remote area and they had they had to live on land they had to hunt and gather their food and they were the only food that were available were were were the foods that were available in the area about 57 hundred years ago 
<Sync time="1301.400"/>
 so the researchers started off by (culturing) the bacteria in their tongue the dental plaque and then used different techniques to evaluate the (infection of the gum tissue) (bleeding) in the gum tissue as well as spaces between the gum the depth of the spaces 
<Sync time="1322.475"/>
 so these 10 people had to find their foods that were all unprocessed healthy foods obviously 
<Sync time="1330.785"/>
 no refined processed (carbohydrates) no refined sugars no refined flowers and the test or the study lasted for 4 weeks
<Sync time="1341.216"/>
 but they could not (brush) or (floss) for 4 weeks 
<Sync time="1346.805"/>
 so the (researchers) were experimenting to say just how much unhealthy plaque would develop
<Sync time="1354.185"/>
 that was the goal of the (paper)
<Sync time="1356.863"/>
 turns out that they had gobs and gobs of dental plaque you might imagine 
<Sync time="1362.270"/>
 and when they cultured the dental plaque from their tongue and from their from the back here of the tongue and the dental plaque again it had gobs and gobs of bacteria but they weren't (virulent) 
<Sync time="1374.825"/>
 and when they tested the (bleeding points) and the (pocket depths) around the gum tissue they were st- statistically significantly healthier 
<Sync time="1386.060"/>
 very interesting
<Sync time="1387.824"/>
 there's another gentleman a (periodontist) in Germany Johann Wölber
<Sync time="1394.092"/>
 he is a periodontist a researcher in the University of Freiburg
<Sync time="1398.176"/>
 and he present- he he he and his staff did a a (randomized control trial) which is kind of the (gold standard) in in research with 15 people
<Sync time="1410.438"/>
 these 15 people had (gum disease) the requirement was they had to have gum disease and they had to be eating a standard American diet and you know what that means 
<Sync time="1420.662"/>
 so here is what he did for the first 2 weeks he had 2 groups 5 were the (control group) 10 were the (experimental group)
<Sync time="1431.622"/>
 the 5 of the control group and the 10 of the experimental group had to (brush their teeth) the same as they normally did but they couldn't (floss) or use (little brushes) between the teeth the couldn't clean between the teeth 
<Sync time="1446.495"/>
 the 5 control group ate their normal standard American diet the 10 experimental group had to eat a (low carb) (nutrient dense) (anti-inflammatory) diet basically a (paleo) slash (Mediterranean diet)
<Sync time="1464.482"/>
 they did this for 2 weeks just get acclimated and then at the start of the test the researchers evaluated inflammation in the gum tissue (bleeding on probing) or pressing on the gum tissue and the (depths of the periodontal pockets) 
<Sync time="1481.700"/>
 4 weeks went by as you might imagine there was a tremendous amount of plaque between the teeth around the teeth but quite a bit of plaque between the teeth
<Sync time="1493.831"/>
 the experimental group that had a healthy diet that could not clean between the teeth but could brush had 50 percent less (bleeding) less (inflammation) and less (pocket depth)
<Sync time="1507.27"/>
 the 5 individuals who were part of the control group that ate their (crappy food) that did not floss between the teeth but they still brushed had significantly more inflammation lots of plaque (deeper pockets) and deeper bleed- more bleeding on probing 
<Sync time="1530.300"/>
 #* basically diet is significantly related to the difference between (healthy plaque) and (unhealthy plaque)
<Sync time="1541.823"/>
 so how do you get unhealthy plaque well the food that you're eating if it is a standard American diet is having effect in a variety of ways
<Sync time="1552.711"/>
 so if you're eating (grains) you're getting (phytic acid) that is pulling out (minerals) in the mouth
<Sync time="1558.742"/>
 if you're eating other foods like (grains) and (sugars) and they're affecting the (gut dysbiosis) they're creating a (leaky gut) and they're creating (chronic inflammation) that eventually goes to the mouth
<Sync time="1571.344"/>
 studies have shown that if you have a leaky gut and chronic inflammation from (dysbiosis in the gut) you will get (dysbiosis in the mouth) you will change healthy plaque into unhealthy plaque
<Sync time="1584.437"/>
 and what's even more important is when you do have dysbiosis in the gut and you're developing unhealthy plaque 
<Sync time="1593.480"/>
 just brush brushing and flossing is not necessarily gonna take care of the problem
<Sync time="1598.057"/>
 and that (unhealthy plaque) becomes very (pathogenic) and it goes from the early stages of gum infection called (gingivitis) to a much more advanced stage of the disease called (periodontitis)
<Sync time="1611.838"/>
 different bacteria start to (proliferate) that are (resistant) to the immune systems' efforts to kill the bacteria
<Sync time="1622.118"/>
 so now under the (gum tissue) because you had this (advanced stage) of (periodontal disease) you're developing (chronic inflammation) 'cause your (immune system) is constantly trying to fight off this bacteria that's very virulent and very resistant
<Sync time="1637.726"/>
 so you're getting (leakage) from the (periodontal pocket) into the (blood system) just like you get leakage from the gut into the blood system 
<Sync time="1648.435"/>
 and now you have 2 (nidus) of infection that create (chronic disease) (cardiovascular disease) (MS) (rheumatoid arthritis) (psoriasis) you can name a bunch of them
<Sync time="1660.445"/>
 and if you only treat the gut dysbiosis which functional medicine does very well but they don't understand the disease in the mouth you won't treat the mouth by treating the dysbiosis in the gut because now you have a new (nidus of infection) in the mouth that's deep
<Sync time="1677.528"/>
 so you have to treat the (gut) and you have to treat the mouth
<Sync time="1681.396"/>
 treat the gut and the mouth get to a healthy diet again nutrient dense anti-inflammatory diet 
<Sync time="1687.980"/>
 you need to have good exercise you have to have good sleep you have to have good stress control you know the four pillars of health it's what my book is all about 
<Sync time="1696.545"/>
 th- that was a plug by the way 
<Sync time="1699.590"/>
 then once you treat these two problems then you can maintain a healthy environment
<Sync time="1706.132"/>
 I believe that you if you take care of the dysbiosis in the gut and you're eating a nutrient dense diet you can treat (chronic disease) 
<Sync time="1715.700"/>
 end of story and my timer just went off
<Sync time="1718.474"/>
@applause wooah 
<Sync time="1720.286"/>
@applause good job awesome
<Sync time="1726.138"/>
 thank you Alvin
<Sync time="1727.317"/>
 so next I'd like to introduce Scott Solomons
<Sync time="1730.524"/>
 Scott got his degree in dentistry at Columbia and he's been practicing for 28 years as a (general dentist) in Connecticut
<Sync time="1738.782"/>
 he has a background in (anthropology) from Binghamton University 
<Sync time="1742.850"/>
 and he has experienced substantial benefits from incorporating evolutionary principles into his diet and lifestyle
<Sync time="1749.141"/>
 he currently incorporates an ancestral perspective in his practice including diet and lifestyle advice
<Sync time="1755.96"/>
 let's welcome Scott
<Sync time="1757.19"/>
 @applause
<Sync time="1758.815"/>
 @applause #* thank you
<Sync time="1760.540"/>
 thanks for that intro
<Sync time="1761.576"/>
 if you ask my patients they would say he (drills) and he knows things that's what he does 
<Sync time="1770.150"/>
 but you're Game of Thrones fans out there 
<Sync time="1773.750"/>
 ah so I'm gonna just give you a little background general dentists basically do all the things that these guys don't do
<Sync time="1783.935"/>
 sort of a catch-all 
<Sync time="1786.170"/>
 and so I want to talk about you know how we can incorporate you know this ancestral idea into dentistry as a whole from my perspective
<Sync time="1800.568"/>
 I do all clinical stuff so that thing about I drill and know things is is true I I try not to drill but I spend most my time in the clinic treating patients and I just study like a nerd 
<Sync time="1817.925"/>
 I'm just look at my cheat sheet here 
<Sync time="1822.305"/>
 so I I generally don't lecture so normally you know it's a one on one kind of a discussion
<Sync time="1831.818"/>
 and so you know I can't ask you guys so what brings you into that
<Sync time="1835.964"/>
 but I'm gonna just ask a few you know questions it's just kind of you know sororal we're all at so
<Sync time="1842.637"/>
 I want you guys to raise your hands if you go to the dentist regularly 
<Sync time="1849.218"/>
 and it's above average I think 50 percent is the national average it's a little higher actually where I am
<Sync time="1856.456"/>
 how many people have ever had a (cavity) a (filling) or anything like that 
<Sync time="1861.740"/>
 most okay and I think it's 91 percent of the population so it's pervasive
<Sync time="1868.908"/>
 okay
<Sync time="1872.503"/>
 (bleeding gums) (gums disease) anything like that going on out there 
<Sync time="1877.861"/>
 well I would say less than average now what do you think
<Sync time="1881.355"/>
 well the statistics would say
<Sync time="1883.794"/>
 do I need to do this
<Sync time="1884.932"/>
 the statistics would say that 91 percent of the US adult population has what's called (gingivitis) which means the gum tissue bleeds 
<Sync time="1899.450"/>
 it doesn't have to bleed when there is a pocket it just bleeds you know
<Sync time="1904.476"/>
 can you give me one minute of this
<Sync time="1906.403"/>
 so if you were if you were looking in yea- in a mirror you're a woman and you're putting on your makeup or you're guy and shaving and you were doing this really closely and there was blood dripping out of your ear would you be concerned 
<Sync time="1921.290"/>
 well the (gum tissue) is as firm as the (cuticle) around your nail it is as protective or more protective than the cuticle around your nail
<Sync time="1931.527"/>
and it shouldn't bleed 
<Sync time="1933.310"/>
 and 91 percent so I'm f- feeling a few of you didn't raise your hand but 91 percent has bleeding gums
<Sync time="1943.16"/>
 now it's not something to be upset about but you need to recognize it
<Sync time="1947.156"/>
 and the reason you have gum disease number one is because your diet
<Sync time="1952.168"/>
there's some other factors but generally diet 
<Sync time="1955.805"/>
 I think we have a cut above here so I believe you guys
<Sync time="1960.515"/>
 okay anybody (crooked teeth) told your (bites) off anything like that
<Sync time="1966.492"/>
okay quite a few 
<Sync time="1968.347"/>
 has anybody ever broken a tooth accident or otherwise 
<Sync time="1975.665"/>
 okay so that that happens and that's you know not any much you could have done about that 
<Sync time="1984.335"/>
 any (temperature sensitivity)
<Sync time="1987.446"/>
 @void
<Sync time="1989.684"/>
 okay quite a few and sensitivity to put (biting hard things) pressure
<Sync time="1996.054"/>
 okay 
<Sync time="1998.150"/>
 and then has anybody had their (wisdom teeth) taken out or have been told
<Sync time="2004.304"/>
 about everybody okay
<Sync time="2008.161"/>
 so this is normal and one you know of the things that I would love to have done was talk to your parents 
<Sync time="2018.283"/>
 and I think Kevin would
<Sync time="2021.691"/>
@laughter 
<Sync time="2025.861"/>
 had to travel through time a little bit but anyway
<Sync time="2028.061"/>
 okay so you know it's it's universal
<Sync time="2030.441"/>
 so you know I do lots of normal dentistry I just wanted to let you know that
<Sync time="2037.353"/>
 sometimes I've been come to these things since the second one and you know some of the lecturers get up there and and they make it seem like this you know this Western medicine approach is terrible 
<Sync time="2049.105"/>
 well it's not
<Sync time="2050.697"/>
 it's quite lovely most of the time
<Sync time="2055.075"/>
 you know it's just they don't use this filter that we're you know that we use here
<Sync time="2061.615"/>
 so hopefully this is gonna go out on YouTube and some of our colleagues can hear this and you know with an open mind and because I just wanted to let you know by the way this is an historic day in dentistry
<Sync time="2075.084"/>
 you you don't realize this but this is the first time that three dentists with an evolutionary perspective have ever been on a podium together 
<Sync time="2085.638"/>
 @applause 
<Sync time="2089.742"/>
the problem is we're the monolith not so good not so good
<Sync time="2095.738"/>
 so with a little luck maybe they'll be 6 of us here next year but we're hoping for more 
<Sync time="2100.615"/>
 okay so look at that video out there and you guys you know do your job and and spread the word please 
<Sync time="2107.695"/>
 let's look at my old cheat sheet here
<Sync time="2110.508"/>
 the cake
<Sync time="2111.198"/>
 #* 
<Sync time="2119.668"/>
 okay so you know my approach also because you know I'm talking to people and they don't want to be there they're miserable 
<Sync time="2127.643"/>
 and you know I ever see try to make everything I can to make them feel at home and comfortable but I really have to boil things down to the simplest possible explanation that can I can't be sitting there citing studies like these guys do they're the brains in the room
<Sync time="2145.455"/>
 where
<Sync time="2148.375"/>
 so you know I sort of take like the the Robb Wolf approach though when it comes to all this in that you know if we don't do something in medicine and dentistry there is not gonna be enough money in the world to to fix all this it's it's too expensive 
<Sync time="2166.570"/>
 so we need to empower you guys and I know I'm preaching to the choir I'll see you guys on the video
<Sync time="2175.015"/>
 you know to to take care of yourselves but having said that there's a continuum of different types of patients
<Sync time="2184.566"/>
 there's gonna be that patient and there's lots of them they generally skew you know the older crowd where they just want a pill and something quick and they don't wanna change
<Sync time="2194.991"/>
 and that's okay that's okay and then there you know all you guys you'll do probably whatever it might take to be healthy and you know you're gonna to embrace change
<Sync time="2207.741"/>
 and so this is the challenge I guess that that we have most of us we sort of have cultivated a #* a lot of people come and expect this but I still see a lot of folks who have no idea what they're getting themselves into 
<Sync time="2225.655"/>
 so you know they can quickly glaze over when I start having this conversation about nutrition and sleep and all that stuff #* what the heck is my dentists talking about sleep for I gotta get out of here
<Sync time="2238.985"/>
 and I have to tell you that I make some of my colleagues that I work with there are many partners where I have a multi-specialty practice 
<Sync time="2247.600"/>
 they get a little nervous they think I've overstepped my bounds but I beg to differ because I feel it's my moral ethical and legal duty to tell you guys all of the options you know that there are out there 
<Sync time="2263.905"/>
 the fact of the matter is there a 8,760 hours in a year
<Sync time="2269.439"/>
 if you're a good patient you gonna come in for 2 hours a year 
<Sync time="2273.970"/>
 it's not up to me to stop you guys from having your dental problems
<Sync time="2277.96"/>
 don't let anybody ever fool you that you know they stopped your problems it's it's gonna be up to you but having said that when you go to the dentist or the doctor you're their boss you pay them okay so they work for you 
<Sync time="2293.785"/>
 and they better well respect whatever you do okay I just want you guys to know there's nobody you know you should never sit there with a finger waving lecture from your health care practitioner
<Sync time="2304.915"/>
 they need to take you as you are and understand you know who you are and what you're willing to do 
<Sync time="2313.154"/>
 okay coup- couple more things and I'll be done to say something now
<Sync time="2316.577"/>
#* the Q&amp;A
<Sync time="2318.014"/>
 okay I'll I'll wrap it up so let me just do my little cake analogy that Kevin seemed to like so much so one of the things that you know I tell my patients is that the recipe for a happy healthy vibrant human being is pretty simple it's sort of like a cake and don't ask me exactly what's in a cake I really don't know
<Sync time="2342.900"/>
 but butter flour sugar (leavening) something else but a few things
<Sync time="2349.259"/>
 so if you put too much flour in a cake it's not gonna really be such a good cake is it so for for a happy healthy vibrant person you need sleep and stress really to you know to be under control
<Sync time="2363.475"/>
 there is a certain level of nutrition we need
<Sync time="2366.284"/>
 movement sunshine you know nice relationships and friends 
<Sync time="2371.772"/>
 and if you have too little of any of those things you gonna be in trouble too much of any of those things sometimes can also get you into trouble and I think so over and over and I turn the mic over to Stefan
<Sync time="2384.395"/>
thanks
<Sync time="2385.147"/>
@applause
<Sync time="2395.730"/>
 thank you very much Kevin Alvin and Scott so now we're gonna transition into the question and answer portion of the panel 
<Sync time="2405.460"/>
 we're gonna take questions from the audience and I'm gonna ask you to please use this microphone when you're asking your questions
<Sync time="2412.43"/>
 we're also gonna have some questions that people left on Facebook
<Sync time="2416.235"/>
 as well as I'm gonna invoke my moderators privilege and throw in a couple of my own so let's take a question from the audience first
<Sync time="2425.603"/>
@garbage-until-the-end 
<Sync time="2432.072"/>
 go over here because can see been standing there for a while 
<Sync time="2433.600"/>
 this was a great discussion I cannot wait till this goes on you to the first person send the link to is my dentist 
<Sync time="2445.120"/>
 you've really liberated me so as small story here mean up until twenty five a crappy diet have 
<Sync time="2455.755"/>
 in our the fillings for that I third on I've eaten pretty much low carb paleo so going to that to my dentist she's great she cleans my teeth she says Wow 
<Sync time="2468.265"/>
 no bleeding gums are healthy but you aren't flossing I brush the need to floss 
<Sync time="2478.330"/>
 you need to floss so you just gave me some great ammunition thank you very much 
<Sync time="2486.970"/>
 to floss right say again I will not say 
<Sync time="2492.520"/>
 you why I would not say 
<Sync time="2497.230"/>
 you do not know if you have healthy dental plaque or unhealthy dental plaque and you do not know if your stress level is under control or your sleep pattern is good or you have efficient exercise or is your diet as good as you think is 
<Sync time="2515.635"/>
 so I would be more proactive and floss but I know in the back of my mind other areas I know that 
<Sync time="2526.360"/>
 gums no caries at all 
<Sync time="2531.715"/>
 if I would say you should not fly guess what's gonna happen so I telling you 
<Sync time="2539.920"/>
 the really need to floss that is I thank you similar answer Todd can set to the so again you have we have patients on a continuum so if I do a little graph 
<Sync time="2555.580"/>
 and you know down in this corner here is the recalcitrant patient does everything wrong and 
<Sync time="2563.095"/>
 this stuff they're inviting trouble aren't so I would obviously encourage that person to floss then you have you guys on the total opposite end of the spectrum her doing everything right 
<Sync time="2577.000"/>
 it would be somewhat less critical but as my daughter when she was web would have said hooah were 
<Sync time="2583.195"/>
 I would make one more addition I brush or floss 
<Sync time="2590.125"/>
 but yeah yes I brush and floss I will the best thing clean between 
<Sync time="2597.225"/>
 the brand soft pick by gum g 
<Sync time="2602.275"/>
 tiny brush 
<Sync time="2605.910"/>
 remain stockholder and I 
<Sync time="2612.880"/>
 are it so at this point I'm gonna ask a question from Facebook here we had a few questions that were related to the same topic that I think is a really interesting topic 
<Sync time="2625.150"/>
 and that is what are the best current recommendations for optimizing a child's John face development both prenatally and postnatally 
<Sync time="2634.420"/>
 and what if the child doesn't want to eat tough or crunchy foods that mechanical forces are one of the things that help 
<Sync time="2642.460"/>
 proper development of the jaws what if that child does not 
<Sync time="2647.400"/>
 starve them and 
<Sync time="2651.220"/>
 the first thing a mom can do and and really this probably starts preconception it's always mom's I mean the guy's got take care a sperm too because person genes but sleep 
<Sync time="2666.475"/>
 gestational apnea we further gestational hypertension 
<Sync time="2670.770"/>
 just something called gestational apnea mom who doesn't might have apnea or breathe mouth mouthwashes pregnant maybe putting her baby at risk for inter uterine growth restriction which also shrinks the jaw 
<Sync time="2685.825"/>
 so that's number one but certainly breastfeeding yet another reason to breastfeed is developing of the powell facial Sutro complex it's the same way the brain grows the Chromium the tongue 
<Sync time="2699.835"/>
 and the breast and the nipple and sucking vacuuming it it starts to develop that our ancestors have become ancestors wouldn't survived childhood unless they ancestrally nursed and weaned baby led weaning look at 
<Sync time="2715.120"/>
 not that's the first thing in terms of you just don't start with Gerber let them start eating I mean they can eat 
<Sync time="2726.025"/>
 percha cannot we can sit up start knowing on things choke baby led weaning google it's amazing 
<Sync time="2735.805"/>
 so that's know press your every child should see the dentist by one okay press your dentist house the shape of the jaw is we're eating that can be done about 
<Sync time="2747.835"/>
 most dentists see children this is starting to just come into the lexicon and were people are learning about it so 
<Sync time="2756.550"/>
 you moved portion I heard you can expand to 
<Sync time="2763.480"/>
 you may be the person to teach your dentist this 
<Sync time="2768.820"/>
 both I took Chris crest sirs adapt functional medicine course we were first class one or more history 
<Sync time="2781.030"/>
 I encourage all of you go to Chris crushers healthy baby code it's awesome I mean there's a fee for but 
<Sync time="2789.040"/>
 well worth it and that there was a cool part on there it's been while since babies but 
<Sync time="2797.125"/>
 I went introduce certain foods just to name the first two egg yolks and liver and when you do this the kids love it 
<Sync time="2808.270"/>
 goes of seen Chris or Rob wolf talk about their paleo kids was was a Chris's 
<Sync time="2816.640"/>
 child maybe who couldn't get enough kimchi what one year old 
<Sync time="2822.725"/>
 which 
<Sync time="2827.415"/>
 I am of all the changes to the jaw gums and teeth poor diet which ones do you think are the most reversible ancestral 
<Sync time="2839.335"/>
 I I'm sorry out of all the changes to the jaw gums and teeth from a poor modern diet which ones do you think are the most reversible from an ancestral diet 
<Sync time="2851.530"/>
 reversible in terms of shape and morphology just ROC quick you guys more 
<Sync time="2858.160"/>
 this has to be done in infancy I mean certainly before the age of six you have got to get in there 
<Sync time="2866.770"/>
 either one of my residents 
<Sync time="2871.390"/>
 Tom Keller he calls it expands aisle foods and they're really just trying to introduce every kid in the try pre industrialized was eating everything that every adult was eating by the age of eleven to twelve months that had have happened 
<Sync time="2890.755"/>
 so I just introducing solid foods and then introducing expansion orthodontic lee if indicated possible 
<Sync time="2903.430"/>
 and about the rest of gum disease recession tooth wear tooth loss it's amazing what we can do 
<Sync time="2914.050"/>
 the thing about 
<Sync time="2916.105"/>
 in the mouth is and again the analogy to Western medicine when body parts fail Western medicine rules 
<Sync time="2925.465"/>
 pretty good 
<Sync time="2927.595"/>
 so again talking that continuum it's better for didn't happen if I need to replace broken part of a tooth decay part of a tooth I'm using a manmade material I'd rather not have to get to that point because there would be issues but 
<Sync time="2945.700"/>
 I'm walking across the Street and I shatter my femur by car going to the emergency room that put as much titanium in there is 
<Sync time="2955.265"/>
 a deal with the other issues that my come with having titanium in in me so 
<Sync time="2961.600"/>
 if you broke off your front tooth or a decayed or something 
<Sync time="2967.540"/>
 everybody sees might pass judgment maybe care maybe _due_ so the way you would want to treat that would would vary some people wouldn't care pull anything foreign in my mouth 
<Sync time="2980.800"/>
 and then if you want to say that there are other things we can do we get into canals stuff 
<Sync time="2988.480"/>
 so again it is a continuum but you look at 
<Sync time="2993.505"/>
 gum disease gingivitis can be reversed very quickly decay these things are you can we can restore these problems we can restore hard tooth structure back to health we can replace receded gums 
<Sync time="3013.320"/>
 comes back up into place and then maintenance would be just of course an ancestral type 
<Sync time="3021.450"/>
 of dental diseases including gum disease and tooth decay are diseases improper diet and chronic 
<Sync time="3031.590"/>
 question is how to prevent them diet elimination of chronic inflammation and chronic inflammation is not necessarily the source the source 
<Sync time="3042.825"/>
 the gut so the gut needs to be treated the diet be right be nutrient dense antiinflammatory foods obviously toxic substances there was 
<Sync time="3055.100"/>
 discussion about glyphosate before glyphosate kills or destroys got bacteria puts holes in the gut lining it destroys the 
<Sync time="3064.080"/>
 country were eating so much quite say in our conventionally raised vegetables and fruits sadly you know the toxic load becomes the problem 
<Sync time="3078.090"/>
 problem intermittent may not be such a problem but if you're eating a wheat product six times day you eat breakfast lunch dinner and snack and snack and snack 
<Sync time="3090.480"/>
 you're going to have dental diseases even if you're brushing and flossing and even thing that three times or every three months for a cleaning 
<Sync time="3102.595"/>
 invoke my moderators privilege now so my question is how about paleo cookies 
<Sync time="3114.600"/>
 feel the same way about paleo cookie as if you know you were smoking unfiltered cigarettes and somebody said here this filtered cigarette will be better for you 
<Sync time="3130.860"/>
 to agreement 
<Sync time="3135.525"/>
 besides the the cookies and and the paleo breads and of these other substitutes for the food that are obviously unhealthy are very heavy and 
<Sync time="3149.980"/>
 they 
<Sync time="3151.710"/>
 wheat products or gluten products but 
<Sync time="3155.670"/>
 they're probably using 
<Sync time="3159.450"/>
 are it's on a get back to question from Facebook here we had several questions about root canals and about whether they are problematic whether they can contribute to health problems 
<Sync time="3174.960"/>
 you got a week and a half 
<Sync time="3178.965"/>
 so yeah again it's a continuum I suppose I out all options for patients it would actually be malpractice if I didn't and the standard of care is a root canal which for those of you know is 
<Sync time="3196.320"/>
 the nerve inside the root of the tooth and soft tissue in general not just nerve 
<Sync time="3202.725"/>
 can get infected or exposed and it's trouble so the idea is that that is cleaned out and 
<Sync time="3212.850"/>
 filling material is put inside the root so that germs care of hide inside the tooth away from your immune system 
<Sync time="3221.880"/>
 healthy it's called the pulp there's a circulation and out of the tooth and the immune system can function and so germs get 
<Sync time="3232.125"/>
 your immune system can take care 
<Sync time="3236.155"/>
 having said that when you look at the majority of the tooth is made of dentin and it's got a whole bunch of tubules 
<Sync time="3247.725"/>
 microscope it's very spongy looking and that can Harbor some bacteria an otherwise healthy person maybe deal with no problem and it checks out okay there's no swelling inflammation the trial 
<Sync time="3265.140"/>
 right 
<Sync time="3267.465"/>
 but sometimes get some nasty bugs in there especially the anaerobes which is which 
<Sync time="3275.685"/>
 and they have a tendency to kick off these Lippo polysaccharide endotoxins which can be pretty nasty and 
<Sync time="3285.150"/>
 keeps talking about that level of inflammation so you can get a lowgrade level of in from inflammation you may not be aware of you may not have any local symptoms around tooth 
<Sync time="3298.620"/>
 so for my patients we always monitor their overall health but if they come in fairly well compromised 
<Sync time="3308.445"/>
 we might say yes a root canal can be done but there are other options and the options are nothing which is generally not a great idea 
<Sync time="3319.575"/>
 having the tooth taken out and the question is should be replaced and how can we replace it that's another discussion 
<Sync time="3328.965"/>
 my opinion 
<Sync time="3333.780"/>
 into a full disclosure here I don't dentists anymore I stopped going years ago as an I think it when it was that will let me not the xrays so standard of care now and they 
<Sync time="3348.600"/>
 have moved around live mouth I grew up so the my sister died of a really aggressive cancer last year I don't do xrays 
<Sync time="3357.135"/>
 never had a cavity never had braces but about me and ask you guys X raise and a toothpaste recommendation and also what about teeth whitening did our ancestors have nice white pearly teeth 
<Sync time="3370.830"/>
 or they slightly yellow that biofilm 
<Sync time="3375.000"/>
 with the toothpaste because not need toothpaste brush 
<Sync time="3381.045"/>
 so if you want to Russian and 
<Sync time="3385.845"/>
 you brush 
<Sync time="3388.700"/>
 but what is fine ideal is obviously non fluoridated water we 
<Sync time="3397.635"/>
 other way whey and filtered water 
<Sync time="3403.290"/>
 is my opinion 
<Sync time="3407.205"/>
 also it helps with whitening take difference and 
<Sync time="3414.065"/>
 some baking soda baking powder baking soda and then brush now baking soda is slightly abrasive but these abrasive ingredient commercial toothpaste it does 
<Sync time="3430.410"/>
 help neutralize the in the now actually decent great but a decent whitener really wanted to Friday white 
<Sync time="3440.385"/>
 salty by the way you could take and make a paste of baking soda and really scrub it 
<Sync time="3449.460"/>
 too hard 
<Sync time="3452.790"/>
 thanks everybody
